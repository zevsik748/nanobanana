# Dynamic Agents
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/agents/dynamic-agents

Dynamic agents use [runtime context](./runtime-variables), like user IDs and other important parameters, to adjust their settings in real-time.

This means they can change the model they use, update their instructions, and select different tools as needed.

By using this context, agents can better respond to each user's needs. They can also call any API to gather more information, which helps improve what the agents can do.

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of a dynamic support agent that adjusts its behavior based on the user's subscription tier and language preferences:

```typescript
const supportAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Dynamic Support Agent",

  instructions: async ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    const userTier = runtimeContext.get("user-tier");
    const language = runtimeContext.get("language");

    return `You are a customer support agent for our SaaS platform.
    The current user is on the ${userTier} tier and prefers ${language} language.
    
    For ${userTier} tier users:
    ${userTier === "free" ? "- Provide basic support and documentation links" : ""}
    ${userTier === "pro" ? "- Offer detailed technical support and best practices" : ""}
    ${userTier === "enterprise" ? "- Provide priority support with custom solutions" : ""}
    
    Always respond in ${language} language.`;
  },

  model: ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    const userTier = runtimeContext.get("user-tier");
    return userTier === "enterprise"
      ? openai("gpt-4")
      : openai("gpt-3.5-turbo");
  },

  tools: ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    const userTier = runtimeContext.get("user-tier");
    const baseTools = [knowledgeBase, ticketSystem];

    if (userTier === "pro" || userTier === "enterprise") {
      baseTools.push(advancedAnalytics);
    }

    if (userTier === "enterprise") {
      baseTools.push(customIntegration);
    }

    return baseTools;
  },
});
```

In this example, the agent:

- Adjusts its instructions based on the user's subscription tier (free, pro, or enterprise)
- Uses a more powerful model (GPT-4) for enterprise users
- Provides different sets of tools based on the user's tier
- Responds in the user's preferred language

This demonstrates how a single agent can handle different types of users and scenarios by leveraging runtime context, making it more flexible and maintainable than creating separate agents for each use case.

For a complete implementation example including API routes, middleware setup, and runtime context handling, see our [Dynamic Agents Example](/examples/agents/dynamic-agents).

# Using Agents
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/agents/overview

**Agents** are one of the core Mastra primitives. Agents use a language model to decide on a sequence of actions. They can call functions (known as _tools_). You can compose them with *workflows* (the other main Mastra primitive), either by giving an agent a workflow as a tool, or by running an agent from within a workflow.

Agents can run autonomously in a loop, run once, or take turns with a user. You can give short-term, long-term, and working memory of their user interactions. They can stream text or return structured output (ie, JSON). They can access third-party APIs, query knowledge bases, and so on.

## 1. Creating an Agent

To create an agent in Mastra, you use the `Agent` class and define its properties:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

export const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: "My Agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});
```

**Note:** Ensure that you have set the necessary environment variables, such as your OpenAI API key, in your `.env` file:

```.env filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Also, make sure you have the `@mastra/core` package installed:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/core@latest
```

### Registering the Agent

Register your agent with Mastra to enable logging and access to configured tools and integrations:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { myAgent } from "./agents";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

## 2. Generating and streaming text

### Generating text

Use the `.generate()` method to have your agent produce text responses:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const response = await myAgent.generate([
  { role: "user", content: "Hello, how can you assist me today?" },
]);

console.log("Agent:", response.text);
```

For more details about the generate method and its options, see the [generate reference documentation](/reference/agents/generate).

### Streaming responses

For more real-time responses, you can stream the agent's response:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const stream = await myAgent.stream([
  { role: "user", content: "Tell me a story." },
]);

console.log("Agent:");

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

For more details about streaming responses, see the [stream reference documentation](/reference/agents/stream).

## 3. Structured Output

Agents can return structured data by providing a JSON Schema or using a Zod schema.

### Using JSON Schema

```typescript
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    summary: { type: "string" },
    keywords: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
  },
  additionalProperties: false,
  required: ["summary", "keywords"],
};

const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please provide a summary and keywords for the following text: ...",
    },
  ],
  {
    output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

### Using Zod

You can also use Zod schemas for type-safe structured outputs.

First, install Zod:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install zod
```

Then, define a Zod schema and use it with the agent:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { z } from "zod";

// Define the Zod schema
const schema = z.object({
  summary: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

// Use the schema with the agent
const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please provide a summary and keywords for the following text: ...",
    },
  ],
  {
    output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

### Using Tools

If you need to generate structured output alongside tool calls, you'll need to use the `experimental_output` property instead of `output`. Here's how:

```typescript
const schema = z.object({
  summary: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please analyze this repository and provide a summary and keywords...",
    },
  ],
  {
    // Use experimental_output to enable both structured output and tool calls
    experimental_output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

<br />

This allows you to have strong typing and validation for the structured data returned by the agent.

## 4. Multi-step tool use

Agents can be enhanced with tools - functions that extend their capabilities beyond text generation. Tools allow agents to perform calculations, access external systems, and process data. Agents not only decide whether to call tools they're given, they determine the parameters that should be given to that tool.

For a detailed guide to creating and configuring tools, see the [Adding Tools documentation](/docs/agents/using-tools-and-mcp), but below are the important things to know.

### Using `maxSteps`

The `maxSteps` parameter controls the maximum number of sequential LLM calls an agent can make, particularly important when using tool calls. By default, it is set to 1 to prevent infinite loops in case of misconfigured tools. You can increase this limit based on your use case:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import * as mathjs from "mathjs";
import { z } from "zod";

export const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: "My Agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant that can solve math problems.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    calculate: {
      description: "Calculator for mathematical expressions",
      schema: z.object({ expression: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ expression }) => mathjs.evaluate(expression),
    },
  },
});

const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "If a taxi driver earns $41 per hour and works 12 hours a day, how much do they earn in one day?",
    },
  ],
  {
    maxSteps: 5, // Allow up to 5 tool usage steps
  },
);
```

### Streaming progress with `onStepFinish`

You can monitor the progress of multi-step operations using the `onStepFinish` callback. This is useful for debugging or providing progress updates to users.

`onStepFinish` is only available when streaming or generating text without structured output.

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
const response = await myAgent.generate(
  [{ role: "user", content: "Calculate the taxi driver's daily earnings." }],
  {
    maxSteps: 5,
    onStepFinish: ({ text, toolCalls, toolResults }) => {
      console.log("Step completed:", { text, toolCalls, toolResults });
    },
  },
);
```

### Detecting completion with `onFinish`

The `onFinish` callback is available when streaming responses and provides detailed information about the completed interaction. It is called after the LLM has finished generating its response and all tool executions have completed.
This callback receives the final response text, execution steps, token usage statistics, and other metadata that can be useful for monitoring and logging:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts" copy
const stream = await myAgent.stream(
  [{ role: "user", content: "Calculate the taxi driver's daily earnings." }],
  {
    maxSteps: 5,
    onFinish: ({
      steps,
      text,
      finishReason, // 'complete', 'length', 'tool', etc.
      usage, // token usage statistics
      reasoningDetails, // additional context about the agent's decisions
    }) => {
      console.log("Stream complete:", {
        totalSteps: steps.length,
        finishReason,
        usage,
      });
    },
  },
);
```

## 5. Testing agents locally

Mastra provides a CLI command `mastra dev` to run your agents behind an API. By default, this looks for exported agents in files in the `src/mastra/agents` directory. It generates endpoints for testing your agent (eg `http://localhost:5000/api/agents/myAgent/generate`) and provides a visual playground where you can chat with an agent and view traces.

For more details, see the [Local Dev Playground](/docs/server-db/local-dev-playground) docs.

description: Learn how to use Mastra's dependency injection system to provide runtime configuration to agents and tools.

# Agent Runtime Context
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/agents/runtime-variables

Mastra provides runtime context, which is a system based on dependency injection that enables you to configure your agents and tools with runtime variables. If you find yourself creating several different agents that do very similar things, runtime context allows you to combine them into one agent.

## Overview

The dependency injection system allows you to:

1. Pass runtime configuration variables to agents through a type-safe runtimeContext
2. Access these variables within tool execution contexts
3. Modify agent behavior without changing the underlying code
4. Share configuration across multiple tools within the same agent

## Basic Usage

```typescript
const agent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");

// Define your runtimeContext's type structure
type WeatherRuntimeContext = {
  "temperature-scale": "celsius" | "fahrenheit"; // Fixed typo in "fahrenheit"
};

const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext<WeatherRuntimeContext>();
runtimeContext.set("temperature-scale", "celsius");

const response = await agent.generate("What's the weather like today?", {
  runtimeContext,
});

console.log(response.text);
```

## Using with REST API

Here's how to dynamically set temperature units based on a user's location using the Cloudflare `CF-IPCountry` header:

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/di";
import { agent as weatherAgent } from "./agents/weather";

// Define RuntimeContext type with clear, descriptive types
type WeatherRuntimeContext = {
  "temperature-scale": "celsius" | "fahrenheit";
};

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: {
    weather: weatherAgent,
  },
  server: {
    middleware: [
      async (c, next) => {
        const country = c.req.header("CF-IPCountry");
        const runtimeContext = c.get<WeatherRuntimeContext>("runtimeContext");

        // Set temperature scale based on country
        runtimeContext.set(
          "temperature-scale",
          country === "US" ? "fahrenheit" : "celsius",
        );

        await next(); // Don't forget to call next()
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Creating Tools with Variables

Tools can access runtimeContext variables and must conform to the agent's runtimeContext type:

```typescript
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "getWeather",
  description: "Get the current weather for a location",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("The location to get weather for"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, runtimeContext }) => {
    // Type-safe access to runtimeContext variables
    const temperatureUnit = runtimeContext.get("temperature-scale");

    const weather = await fetchWeather(context.location, {
      temperatureUnit,
    });

    return { result: weather };
  },
});

async function fetchWeather(
  location: string,
  { temperatureUnit }: { temperatureUnit: "celsius" | "fahrenheit" },
): Promise<WeatherResponse> {
  // Implementation of weather API call
  const response = await weatherApi.fetch(location, temperatureUnit);

  return {
    location,
    temperature: "72°F",
    conditions: "Sunny",
    unit: temperatureUnit,
  };
}
```

title: "Using Tools with Agents | Agents | Mastra Docs"
description: Learn how to create tools, add them to Mastra agents, and integrate tools from MCP servers.

# Using Tools with Agents
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/agents/using-tools-and-mcp

Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows. Each tool has a schema defining its inputs, an executor function implementing its logic, and optional access to configured integrations.

## Creating Tools

Here's a basic example of creating a tool:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/weatherInfo.ts" copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const weatherInfo = createTool({
  id: "Get Weather Information",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  execute: async ({ context: { city } }) => {
    // Tool logic here (e.g., API call)
    console.log("Using tool to fetch weather information for", city);
    return { temperature: 20, conditions: "Sunny" }; // Example return
  },
});
```

For details on creating and designing tools, see the [Tools Overview](/docs/tools-mcp/overview).

## Adding Tools to an Agent

To make a tool available to an agent, add it to the `tools` property in the agent's configuration.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/weatherAgent.ts" {3,11}
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { weatherInfo } from "../tools/weatherInfo";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Weather Agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that provides current weather information. When asked about the weather, use the weather information tool to fetch the data.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    weatherInfo,
  },
});
```

When you call the agent, it can now decide to use the configured tool based on its instructions and the user's prompt.

## Adding MCP Tools to an Agent

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) provides a standardized way for AI models to discover and interact with external tools and resources. You can connect your Mastra agent to MCP servers to use tools provided by third parties.

For more details on MCP concepts and how to set up MCP clients and servers, see the [MCP Overview](/docs/tools-mcp/mcp-overview).

### Installation

First, install the Mastra MCP package:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/mcp@latest
```

### Using MCP Tools

Because there are so many MCP server registries to choose from, we've created an [MCP Registry Registry](https://mastra.ai/mcp-registry-registry) to help you find MCP servers.

Once you have a server you want to use with your agent, import the Mastra `MCPClient` and add the server configuration.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/mcp.ts" {1,7-16}
import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

// Configure MCPClient to connect to your server(s)
export const mcp = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    filesystem: {
      command: "npx",
      args: [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/username/Downloads",
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

Then connect your agent to the server tools:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/mcpAgent.ts" {7}
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { mcp } from "../mcp";

// Create an agent and add tools from the MCP client
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Agent with MCP Tools",
  instructions: "You can use tools from connected MCP servers.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: await mcp.getTools(),
});
```

For more details on configuring `MCPClient` and the difference between static and dynamic MCP server configurations, see the [MCP Overview](/docs/tools-mcp/mcp-overview).

## Accessing MCP Resources

In addition to tools, MCP servers can also expose resources - data or content that can be retrieved and used in your application.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/resources.ts" {3-8}
import { mcp } from "./mcp";

// Get resources from all connected MCP servers
const resources = await mcp.getResources();

// Access resources from a specific server
if (resources.filesystem) {
  const resource = resources.filesystem.find(
    (r) => r.uri === "filesystem://Downloads",
  );
  console.log(`Resource: ${resource?.name}`);
}
```

Each resource has a URI, name, description, and MIME type. The `getResources()` method handles errors gracefully - if a server fails or doesn't support resources, it will be omitted from the results.

## Accessing MCP Prompts

MCP servers can also expose prompts, which represent structured message templates or conversational context for agents.

### Listing Prompts

```typescript filename="src/mastra/prompts.ts"
import { mcp } from "./mcp";

// Get prompts from all connected MCP servers
const prompts = await mcp.prompts.list();

// Access prompts from a specific server
if (prompts.weather) {
  const prompt = prompts.weather.find(
    (p) => p.name === "current"
  );
  console.log(`Prompt: ${prompt?.name}`);
}
```

Each prompt has a name, description, and (optional) version.

### Retrieving a Prompt and Its Messages

```typescript filename="src/mastra/prompts.ts"
const { prompt, messages } = await mcp.prompts.get({ serverName: "weather", name: "current" });
console.log(prompt);    // { name: "current", version: "v1", ... }
console.log(messages);  // [ { role: "assistant", content: { type: "text", text: "..." } }, ... ]
```

## Exposing Agents as Tools via MCPServer

In addition to using tools from MCP servers, your Mastra Agents themselves can be exposed as tools to any MCP-compatible client using Mastra's `MCPServer`.

When an `Agent` instance is provided to an `MCPServer` configuration:

- It is automatically converted into a callable tool.
- The tool is named `ask_<agentKey>`, where `<agentKey>` is the identifier you used when adding the agent to the `MCPServer`'s `agents` configuration.
- The agent's `description` property (which must be a non-empty string) is used to generate the tool's description.

This allows other AI models or MCP clients to interact with your Mastra Agents as if they were standard tools, typically by "asking" them a question.

**Example `MCPServer` Configuration with an Agent:**

```typescript filename="src/mastra/mcp.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { weatherInfo } from "../tools/weatherInfo";
import { generalHelper } from "../agents/generalHelper";

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: "My Custom Server with Agent-Tool",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: {
    weatherInfo,
  },
  agents: { generalHelper }, // Exposes 'ask_generalHelper' tool
});
```

For an agent to be successfully converted into a tool by `MCPServer`, its `description` property must be set to a non-empty string in its constructor configuration. If the description is missing or empty, `MCPServer` will throw an error during initialization.

For more details on setting up and configuring `MCPServer`, refer to the [MCPServer reference documentation](/reference/tools/mcp-server).

# Using with Vercel AI SDK
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/frameworks/agentic-uis/ai-sdk

Mastra leverages AI SDK's model routing (a unified interface on top of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc), structured output, and tool calling.

We explain this in greater detail in [this blog post](https://mastra.ai/blog/using-ai-sdk-with-mastra)

## Mastra + AI SDK

Mastra acts as a layer on top of AI SDK to help teams productionize their proof-of-concepts quickly and easily.

<Image
  src="/image/mastra-ai-sdk.png"
  alt="Agent interaction trace showing spans, LLM calls, and tool executions"
  style={{ maxWidth: "800px", width: "100%", margin: "8px 0" }}
  className="nextra-image rounded-md py-8"
  data-zoom
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

## Model routing

When creating agents in Mastra, you can specify any AI SDK-supported model:

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "WeatherAgent",
  instructions: "Instructions for the agent...",
  model: openai("gpt-4-turbo"), // Model comes directly from AI SDK
});

const result = await agent.generate("What is the weather like?");
```

## AI SDK Hooks

Mastra is compatible with AI SDK's hooks for seamless frontend integration:

### useChat

The `useChat` hook enables real-time chat interactions in your frontend application

- Works with agent data streams i.e. `.toDataStreamResponse()`
- The useChat `api` defaults to `/api/chat`
- Works with the Mastra REST API agent stream endpoint `{MASTRA_BASE_URL}/agents/:agentId/stream` for data streams,
  i.e. no structured output is defined.

```typescript filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" copy
import { mastra } from "@/src/mastra";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  const myAgent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
  const stream = await myAgent.stream(messages);

  return stream.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

```typescript copy
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export function ChatComponent() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({
    api: '/path-to-your-agent-stream-api-endpoint'
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map(m => (
        <div key={m.id}>
          {m.role}: {m.content}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={handleInputChange}
          placeholder="Say something..."
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> **Gotcha**: When using `useChat` with agent memory functionality, make sure to check out the [Agent Memory section](/docs/agents/agent-memory#usechat) for important implementation details.

### useCompletion

For single-turn completions, use the `useCompletion` hook:

- Works with agent data streams i.e. `.toDataStreamResponse()`
- The useCompletion `api` defaults to `/api/completion`
- Works with the Mastra REST API agent stream endpoint `{MASTRA_BASE_URL}/agents/:agentId/stream` for data streams,
  i.e. no structured output is defined.

```typescript filename="app/api/completion/route.ts" copy
import { mastra } from "@/src/mastra";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { prompt } = await req.json();
  const myAgent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
  const stream = await myAgent.stream([{ role: "user", content: prompt }]);

  return stream.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

```typescript
import { useCompletion } from "@ai-sdk/react";

export function CompletionComponent() {
  const {
    completion,
    input,
    handleInputChange,
    handleSubmit,
  } = useCompletion({
  api: '/path-to-your-agent-stream-api-endpoint'
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          onChange={handleInputChange}
          placeholder="Enter a prompt..."
        />
      </form>
      <p>Completion result: {completion}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useObject

For consuming text streams that represent JSON objects and parsing them into a complete object based on a schema.

- Works with agent text streams i.e. `.toTextStreamResponse()`
- Works with the Mastra REST API agent stream endpoint `{MASTRA_BASE_URL}/agents/:agentId/stream` for text streams,
  i.e. structured output is defined.

```typescript filename="app/api/use-object/route.ts" copy
import { mastra } from "@/src/mastra";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const body = await req.json();
  const myAgent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
  const stream = await myAgent.stream(body, {
    output: z.object({
      weather: z.string(),
    }),
  });

  return stream.toTextStreamResponse();
}
```

```typescript
import { experimental_useObject as useObject } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { object, submit } = useObject({
    api: '/api/use-object',
    schema: z.object({
      weather: z.string(),
    }),
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => submit('example input')}>Generate</button>
      {object?.weather && <p>{object.weather}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### With additional data / RuntimeContext

You can send additional data via the UI hooks that can be leveraged in Mastra as RuntimeContext using the `sendExtraMessageFields` option.

#### Frontend: Using sendExtraMessageFields

```typescript
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export function ChatComponent() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({
    api: '/api/chat',
    sendExtraMessageFields: true, // Enable sending extra fields
  });

  const handleFormSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
        e.preventDefault();        
        handleSubmit(e,{
            // Add context data to the message
            data: {
                userId: 'user123',
                preferences: { language: 'en', temperature: 'celsius' },
            },
        });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleFormSubmit}>
      <input value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
    </form>
  );
}
```

#### Backend: Handling in API Route

```typescript filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" copy
import { mastra } from "@/src/mastra";
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/runtime-context";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages, data } = await req.json();
  const myAgent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
  
  const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
  
  if (data) {
    Object.entries(data).forEach(([key, value]) => {
      runtimeContext.set(key, value);
    });
  }
  
  const stream = await myAgent.stream(messages, { runtimeContext });
  return stream.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

#### Alternative: Server Middleware

You can also handle this at the server middleware level:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent },
  server: {
    middleware: [
      async (c, next) => {
        const runtimeContext = c.get("runtimeContext");
        
        if (c.req.method === 'POST') {
          try {
            // Clone the request since reading the body can only be done once
            const clonedReq = c.req.raw.clone();
            const body = await clonedReq.json();
            
            
            if (body?.data) {
              Object.entries(body.data).forEach(([key, value]) => {
                runtimeContext.set(key, value);
              });
            }
          } catch {
            // Continue without additional data
          }
        }
        
        await next();
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

You can then access this data in your tools via the `runtimeContext` parameter. See the [Runtime Context documentation](/docs/agents/runtime-variables) for more details.

## Tool Calling

### AI SDK Tool Format

Mastra supports tools created using the AI SDK format, so you can use
them directly with Mastra agents. See our tools doc on [Vercel AI SDK Tool Format
](/docs/agents/adding-tools#vercel-ai-sdk-tool-format) for more details.

### Client-side tool calling

Mastra leverages AI SDK's tool calling, so what applies in AI SDK applies here still.
[Agent Tools](/docs/agents/adding-tools) in Mastra are 100% percent compatible with AI SDK tools.

Mastra tools also expose an optional `execute` async function. It is optional because you might want to forward tool calls to the client or to a queue instead of executing them in the same process.

One way to then leverage client-side tool calling is to use the `@ai-sdk/react` `useChat` hook's `onToolCall` property for
client-side tool execution

## Custom DataStream

In certain scenarios you need to write custom data, message annotations to an agent's dataStream.
This can be useful for:

- Streaming additional data to the client
- Passing progress info back to the client in real time

Mastra integrates well with AI SDK to make this possible

### CreateDataStream

The `createDataStream` function allows you to stream additional data to the client

```typescript copy
import { createDataStream } from "ai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Weather Agent",
  instructions: `
          You are a helpful weather assistant that provides accurate weather information.

          Your primary function is to help users get weather details for specific locations. When responding:
          - Always ask for a location if none is provided
          - If the location name isn't in English, please translate it
          - If giving a location with multiple parts (e.g. "New York, NY"), use the most relevant part (e.g. "New York")
          - Include relevant details like humidity, wind conditions, and precipitation
          - Keep responses concise but informative

          Use the weatherTool to fetch current weather data.
    `,
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools: { weatherTool },
});

const stream = createDataStream({
  async execute(dataStream) {
    // Write data
    dataStream.writeData({ value: "Hello" });

    // Write annotation
    dataStream.writeMessageAnnotation({ type: "status", value: "processing" });

    //mastra agent stream
    const agentStream = await weatherAgent.stream("What is the weather");

    // Merge agent stream
    agentStream.mergeIntoDataStream(dataStream);
  },
  onError: (error) => `Custom error: ${error.message}`,
});
```

### CreateDataStreamResponse

The `createDataStreamResponse` function creates a Response object that streams data to the client

```typescript filename="app/api/chat/route.ts" copy
import { mastra } from "@/src/mastra";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  const myAgent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
  //mastra agent stream
  const agentStream = await myAgent.stream(messages);

  const response = createDataStreamResponse({
    status: 200,
    statusText: "OK",
    headers: {
      "Custom-Header": "value",
    },
    async execute(dataStream) {
      // Write data
      dataStream.writeData({ value: "Hello" });

      // Write annotation
      dataStream.writeMessageAnnotation({
        type: "status",
        value: "processing",
      });

      // Merge agent stream
      agentStream.mergeIntoDataStream(dataStream);
    },
    onError: (error) => `Custom error: ${error.message}`,
  });

  return response;
}
```

import { Callout, FileTree, Steps } from 'nextra/components'

# Using with Assistant UI
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/frameworks/agentic-uis/assistant-ui

[Assistant UI](https://assistant-ui.com) is the TypeScript/React library for AI Chat.
Built on shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, it enables developers to create beautiful, enterprise-grade chat experiences in minutes.

<Callout type="info">
For a full-stack integration approach where Mastra runs directly in your Next.js API routes, see the [Full-Stack Integration Guide](https://www.assistant-ui.com/docs/runtimes/mastra/full-stack-integration) on Assistant UI's documentation site.
</Callout>

## Integration Guide

Run Mastra as a standalone server and connect your Next.js frontend (with Assistant UI) to its API endpoints.

<Steps>
### Create Standalone Mastra Server

Set up your directory structure. A possible directory structure could look like this:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="project-root" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="mastra-server" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.Folder name="src">
                <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
            <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="nextjs-frontend">
            <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Bootstrap your Mastra server:

```bash copy
npx create-mastra@latest
```

This command will launch an interactive wizard to help you scaffold a new Mastra project, including prompting you for a project name and setting up basic configurations.
Follow the prompts to create your server project.

You now have a basic Mastra server project ready. You should have the following files and folders:

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="agents" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="weather-agent.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="tools" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="weather-tool.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="workflows" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="weather-workflow.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

<Callout>
Ensure that you have set the appropriate environment variables for your LLM provider in the `.env` file.
</Callout>

### Compatibility Fix

Currently, to ensure proper compatibility between Mastra and Assistant UI, you need to setup server middleware. Update your `/mastra/index.ts` file with the following configuration:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  //mastra server middleware
  server:{
  middleware: [{
    path: '/api/agents/*/stream',
    handler: async (c,next)=>{
    
      const body = await c.req.json();
  
      if ('state' in body && body.state == null) {
        delete body.state;
        delete body.tools;
      }
  
       c.req.json = async() => body;
  
      return next()
    }
  }]
 },
});
```

This middleware ensures that when Assistant UI sends a request with `state: null` and `tools: {}` in the request body, we remove those properties to make the request work properly with Mastra.

<Callout type="info">
The `state: null` property can cause errors like `Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'input' in null` in Mastra. Additionally, passing `tools: {}` overrides Mastra's built-in tools. Mastra only supports `clientTools` via the Mastra client SDK from the client side. For more information about client tools, see the [Client Tools documentation](/reference/client-js/agents#client-tools).
</Callout>

### Run the Mastra Server

Run the Mastra server using the following command:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

By default, the Mastra server will run on `http://localhost:5000`. Your `weatherAgent` should now be accessible via a POST request endpoint, typically `http://localhost:5000/api/agents/weatherAgent/stream`. Keep this server running for the next steps where we'll set up the Assistant UI frontend to connect to it.

### Initialize Assistant UI

Create a new `assistant-ui` project with the following command.

```bash copy
npx assistant-ui@latest create
```

<Callout>For detailed setup instructions, including adding API keys, basic configuration, and manual setup steps, please refer to [assistant-ui's official documentation](https://assistant-ui.com/docs).</Callout>

### Configure Frontend API Endpoint

The default Assistant UI setup configures the chat runtime to use a local API route (`/api/chat`) within the Next.js project. Since our Mastra agent is running on a separate server, we need to update the frontend to point to that server's endpoint.

Find the `useChatRuntime` hook in the `assistant-ui` project, typically at `app/assistant.tsx` and change the `api` property to the full URL of your Mastra agent's stream endpoint:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="app/assistant.tsx" {2}
const runtime = useChatRuntime({
    api: "http://localhost:5000/api/agents/weatherAgent/stream",
});
```

Now, the Assistant UI frontend will send chat requests directly to your running Mastra server.

### Run the Application

You're ready to connect the pieces! Make sure both the Mastra server and the Assistant UI frontend are running. Start the Next.js development server:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to chat with your agent in the browser.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Mastra with Assistant UI using a separate server approach. Your Assistant UI frontend now communicates with a standalone Mastra agent server.

# Using with CopilotKit in React
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/frameworks/agentic-uis/copilotkit

CopilotKit provides React components to quickly integrate customizable AI copilots into your application.
Combined with Mastra, you can build sophisticated AI apps featuring bidirectional state synchronization and interactive UIs.

## Create a Mastra Project
{/*
LLM CONTEXT:
This Tabs component shows commands for creating a new Mastra project using different package managers.
Each tab displays the command for that specific package manager to create a Mastra project.
This is the first step in setting up Mastra with CopilotKit for building AI copilot applications.
All commands create the same Mastra project but use different package manager syntax.
*/}

<Tabs items={["npx", "npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npx create-mastra@latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm create mastra
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn create mastra
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm create mastra
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


Select the agent example when scaffolding your project. This will give you a weather agent.

For detailed setup instructions, see the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation).

## Basic Setup

Integrating Mastra with CopilotKit involves two main steps: setting up the backend runtime and configuring your frontend components.
{/*
LLM CONTEXT: This Tabs component shows installation commands for the CopilotKit runtime package.
Each tab displays the installation command for that specific package manager.
This installs the core CopilotKit runtime needed for backend integration with Mastra.
All commands install the same @copilotkit/runtime package but use different package manager syntax.
*/}

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install @copilotkit/runtime
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add @copilotkit/runtime
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add @copilotkit/runtime
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Set up the runtime

You can leverage Mastra's custom API routes to add CopilotKit's runtime to your Mastra server.

The current version of the integration leverages `MastraClient` to format Mastra agents into the AGUI format of CopilotKit.

{/*
LLM CONTEXT: This Tabs component shows installation commands for the Mastra AGUI package.
Each tab displays the installation command for that specific package manager.
This installs the alpha version of @ag-ui/mastra which provides CopilotKit integration capabilities.
All commands install the same @ag-ui/mastra package but use different package manager syntax.
*/}

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install @ag-ui/mastra
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add @ag-ui/mastra
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add @ag-ui/mastra
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, let's update the Mastra instance with a custom API route for CopilotKit.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";
import { CopilotRuntime, copilotRuntimeNodeHttpEndpoint, ExperimentalEmptyAdapter } from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { registerCopilotKit } from "@ag-ui/mastra";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weather-agent";

const serviceAdapter = new ExperimentalEmptyAdapter();

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent },
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    // stores telemetry, evals, ... into memory storage,
    // if you need to persist, change to file:../mastra.db
    url: ":memory:"
  }),
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info"
  }),
  server: {
    // We will be calling this from a Vite App. Allow CORS
    cors: {
      origin: "*",
      allowMethods: ["*"],
      allowHeaders: ["*"]
    },
    apiRoutes: [
      registerCopilotKit({
        path: "/copilotkit",
        resourceId: "weatherAgent",
        setContext: (c, runtimeContext) => {
          // Add whatever you need to the runtimeContext
          runtimeContext.set("user-id", c.req.header("X-User-ID"));
          runtimeContext.set("temperature-scale", "celsius");
        }
      })
    ]
  }
});
```

With this setup you now have CopilotKit running on your Mastra server. You can start your Mastra server with `mastra dev`.

## Set up the UI

Install CopilotKit's React components:
{/*
LLM CONTEXT: This Tabs component shows installation commands for CopilotKit's React UI components.
Each tab displays the installation command for that specific package manager.
This installs the React components needed for the frontend CopilotKit integration.
All commands install the same @copilotkit/react-core and @copilotkit/react-ui packages but use different package manager syntax.
*/}

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/react-ui
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/react-ui
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/react-ui
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, add CopilotKit's React components to your frontend.

```jsx copy
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import "@copilotkit/react-ui/styles.css";

export function CopilotKitComponent() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit
      runtimeUrl="http://localhost:5000/copilotkit"
      agent="weatherAgent"
    >
      <CopilotChat
        labels={{
          title: "Your Assistant",
          initial: "Hi! 👋 How can I assist you today?",
        }}
      />
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}
```

Render the component and start building the future!

<Image
  className="rounded-lg"
  src="/image/copilotkit/cpkoutput.jpg"
  alt="CopilotKit output"
  width={700}
  height={700}
/>

## Using with other frameworks (NextJS)

You can still leverage AGUI without going through Mastra Server.

```typescript copy
// import your mastra instance from dir
import { mastra } from "../path/to/mastra";
import {
  CopilotRuntime,
  ExperimentalEmptyAdapter,
  copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint,
} from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { MastraAgent } from "@ag-ui/mastra";

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  // Clone the request before reading the body
  const clonedReq = req.clone();
  const body = await clonedReq.json();
  const resourceId = body.resourceId || "TEST";

  const mastraAgents = MastraAgent.getLocalAgents({
    resourceId,
    mastra,
    runtimeContext,
  });

  const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
    agents: mastraAgents,
  });

  const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
    runtime,
    serviceAdapter: new ExperimentalEmptyAdapter(),
    endpoint: "/api/copilotkit",
  });

  // Use the original request for handleRequest
  return handleRequest(req);
};
```

## Using with Mastra Client SDK

```typescript copy
import { MastraClient } from "@mastra/client-js";
import {
  CopilotRuntime,
  ExperimentalEmptyAdapter,
  copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint,
} from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { MastraAgent } from "@ag-ui/mastra";

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  // Clone the request before reading the body
  const clonedReq = req.clone();
  const body = await clonedReq.json();
  const resourceId = body.resourceId || "TEST";

  const baseUrl = process.env.MASTRA_BASE_URL || "http://localhost:5000";
  const mastraClient = new MastraClient({
    baseUrl,
  });

  const mastraAgents = await MastraAgent.getRemoteAgents({ mastraClient });

  const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
    agents: mastraAgents,
  });

  const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
    runtime,
    serviceAdapter: new ExperimentalEmptyAdapter(),
    endpoint: "/api/copilotkit",
  });

  // Use the original request for handleRequest
  return handleRequest(req);
};
```


## Using Typed Runtime Context

For better type safety, you can specify the type of your runtime context:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";
import { registerCopilotKit } from "@ag-ui/mastra";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents";

// Define your runtime context type
type WeatherRuntimeContext = {
  "user-id": string;
  "temperature-scale": "celsius" | "fahrenheit";
  "api-key": string;
};

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent },
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    url: ":memory:",
  }),
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
  server: {
    cors: {
      origin: "*",
      allowMethods: ["*"],
      allowHeaders: ["*"],
    },
    apiRoutes: [
      registerCopilotKit<WeatherRuntimeContext>({
        path: "/copilotkit",
        resourceId: "weatherAgent",
        setContext: (c, runtimeContext) => {
          // TypeScript will enforce the correct types here
          runtimeContext.set("user-id", c.req.header("X-User-ID") || "anonymous");
          runtimeContext.set("temperature-scale", "celsius"); // Only "celsius" | "fahrenheit" allowed
          runtimeContext.set("api-key", process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY || "");

          // This would cause a TypeScript error:
          // runtimeContext.set("invalid-key", "value"); // ❌ Error: invalid key
          // runtimeContext.set("temperature-scale", "kelvin"); // ❌ Error: invalid value
        }
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

Integrate OpenRouter with Mastra to leverage the numerous models available on OpenRouter.

<Steps>
## Initialize a Mastra Project

The simplest way to get started with Mastra is to use the `mastra` CLI to initialize a new project:

```bash copy
npx create-mastra@latest
```

You'll be guided through prompts to set up your project. For this example, select:
- Name your project: my-mastra-openrouter-app
- Components: Agents (recommended)
- For default provider, select OpenAI (recommended) - we'll configure OpenRouter manually later
- Optionally include example code

## Configure OpenRouter

After creating your project with `create-mastra`, you'll find a `.env` file in your project root.
Since we selected OpenAI during setup, we'll configure OpenRouter manually: 

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
```

We remove the `@ai-sdk/openai` package from the project:

```bash copy
npm uninstall @ai-sdk/openai
```

Then, we install the `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` package:

```bash copy
npm install @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider
```

## Configure your Agent to use OpenRouter

We will now configure our agent to use OpenRouter.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/assistant.ts" copy showLineNumbers {4-6,11}
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createOpenRouter } from "@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider";

const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
})

export const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "assistant",
    instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    model: openrouter("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"),
})
```

Make sure to register your agent to the Mastra instance:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy showLineNumbers {4}
import { assistant } from "./agents/assistant";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
    agents: { assistant }
})
```

## Run and Test your Agent

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

This will start the Mastra development server.

You can now test your agent by visiting [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) for the playground or via the Mastra API at [http://localhost:5000/api/agents/assistant/stream](http://localhost:5000/api/agents/assistant/stream).

</Steps>

## Advanced Configuration

For more control over your OpenRouter requests, you can pass additional configuration options.

### Provider-wide options:

You can pass provider-wide options to the OpenRouter provider:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/assistant.ts" {6-10} copy showLineNumbers
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createOpenRouter } from "@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider";

const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
    extraBody: {
        reasoning: {
            max_tokens: 10,
        }
    }
})

export const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "assistant",
    instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    model: openrouter("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"),
})
```

### Model-specific options:

You can pass model-specific options to the OpenRouter provider:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/assistant.ts" {11-17} copy showLineNumbers
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createOpenRouter } from "@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider";

const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
})

export const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "assistant",
    instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    model: openrouter("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4", {
        extraBody: {
            reasoning: {
                max_tokens: 10,
            }
        }
    }),
})
```

### Provider-specific options:

You can pass provider-specific options to the OpenRouter provider:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers {7-12}
// Get a response with provider-specific options
const response = await assistant.generate([
  {
    role: 'system',
    content:
      'You are Chef Michel, a culinary expert specializing in ketogenic (keto) diet...',
    providerOptions: {
      // Provider-specific options - key can be 'anthropic' or 'openrouter'
      anthropic: {
        cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: 'Can you suggest a keto breakfast?',
  },
]);
```


# AI SDK v5 (beta) Migration Guide
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/frameworks/ai-sdk-v5

This guide covers Mastra-specific considerations when migrating from AI SDK v4 to v5 beta.

Please add any feedback or bug reports to the [AI SDK v5 mega issue in Github.](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/5470)

## Official Migration Guide

**Follow the official [AI SDK v5 Migration Guide](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/migration-guides/migration-guide-5-0)** for all AI SDK core breaking changes, package updates, and API changes.

This guide covers only the Mastra-specific aspects of the migration.

## Warnings

- **Data compatibility**: New data stored in v5 format will no longer work if you downgrade from the beta
- **Backup recommendation**: Keep DB backups from before you upgrade to v5 beta
- **Production use**: Wait for the AI SDK v5 stable release before using in production applications
- **Prerelease status**: The Mastra `ai-v5` tag is a prerelease version and may have bugs

## Memory Storage

Your existing AI SDK v4 data will run through our internal `MessageList` class which handles converting to/from various message formats.
This includes converting from AI SDK v4->v5. This means you don't need to run any DB migrations and your data will be translated on the fly and will just work when you upgrade.


## Migration Strategy

Migrating to AI SDK v5 with Mastra involves updating both your **backend** (Mastra server) and **frontend**.
We provide a compatibility mode to handle stream format conversion during the transition.

### Backend Upgrade

Bump Mastra to the new `ai-v5` prerelease version for all Mastra packages:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm i mastra@ai-v5 @mastra/core@ai-v5 @mastra/memory@ai-v5 [etc]
```

Then configure your Mastra instance with v4 compatibility so your existing frontend will continue to work:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { myAgent },
  aiSdkCompat: 'v4', // <- add this for compatibility
});
```

#### Dependencies

You will need to upgrade all AI SDK dependencies to use the new v5 beta versions in your backend when you bump to the Mastra `ai-v5` prerelease tag.

In most cases this will only involve bumping your model provider packages. For example: `npm i @ai-sdk/openai@2.0.0-beta.1` - refer to the [AI SDK v5 documentation](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev/docs/migration-guides/migration-guide-5-0) for more info. Some model providers do not yet have V5 versions (Openrouter for example).

Also note that you need to bump all your Mastra dependencies to the new `ai-v5` tag, and you must upgrade `zod` to the latest version if you have it installed.

#### Using Stream Compatibility Manually

If you have a frontend that calls Mastra agents in an endpoint, you can wrap the new `response.toUIMessageStreamResponse()` manually.

```ts
import { mastra } from "@/src/mastra";
import { createV4CompatibleResponse } from "@mastra/core/agent";

const myAgent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
  const stream = await myAgent.stream(messages);

  return createV4CompatibleResponse(stream.toUIMessageStreamResponse().body!);
}
```

### Using Mastra Playground

Currently playground is still an AI SDK v4 frontend. For now you need to set `aiSdkCompat: 'v4'` for it to work.
We'll handle this automatically for you soon.

### Frontend Upgrade

When you're ready, remove the compatibility flag and upgrade your frontend:

1. Remove `aiSdkCompat: 'v4'` from your Mastra configuration
2. Follow the AI SDK guide on upgrading your frontend dependencies
3. Update your frontend code for v5 breaking changes

## Discussion and Bug Reports

Please add any feedback or bug reports to the [AI SDK v5 mega issue in Github.](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/issues/5470)

title: "Getting started with Mastra and Express | Mastra Guides"
description: A step-by-step guide to integrating Mastra with an Express backend.
---

import { Callout, Steps, Tabs, FileTree } from "nextra/components";

# Integrate Mastra in your Express project
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/frameworks/servers/express

Mastra integrates with Express, making it easy to:

- Build flexible APIs to serve AI-powered features
- Maintain full control over your server logic and routing
- Scale your backend independently of your frontend

Use this guide to scaffold and integrate Mastra with your Express project.

<Callout type="warning">
This setup is compatible with the following package versions:
- `express`: 4.x
- `@types/express`: 4.x

Type compatibility in 5.x can be inconsistent while `express` and `@types/express` evolve toward alignment.

</Callout>

<Steps>
## Install Mastra

Install the required Mastra packages:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm install mastra@latest @mastra/core@latest @mastra/libsql@latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add mastra@latest @mastra/core@latest @mastra/libsql@latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add mastra@latest @mastra/core@latest @mastra/libsql@latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    bun add mastra@latest @mastra/core@latest @mastra/libsql@latest
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Integrate Mastra

To integrate Mastra in your project, you have two options:

### 1. Use the One-Liner

Run the following command to quickly scaffold the default Weather agent with sensible defaults:

```bash copy
npx mastra@latest init --default
```

> See [mastra init](/reference/cli/init) for more information.

### 2. Use the Interactive CLI

If you prefer to customize the setup, run the `init` command and choose from the options when prompted:

```bash copy
npx mastra@latest init
```

Add the `dev` and `build` scripts to `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "dev": "mastra dev",
    "build": "mastra build"
  }
}
```

> If your project already uses `dev` and `build` scripts, we recommend using: `dev:mastra` and `build:mastra`.

## Initialize TypeScript

Create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project root with the following configuration:

```json filename="tsconfig.json" copy
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ES2022",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", ".mastra"]
}
```

> This TypeScript configuration is optimized for Mastra projects, using modern module resolution and strict type checking.

## Set Up API Key

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

> Each llm provider uses a different env var. See [Model Capabilities](/docs/getting-started/model-capability) for more information.

## Start the Mastra Dev Server

Start the Mastra dev server to expose your agents as REST endpoints:

<Tabs items={["npm", "CLI"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    mastra dev
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

> Once running, your agents are available locally. See [Local Development Environment](/docs/server-db/local-dev-playground) for more information.

## Example Express App

This example creates an `/api/weather` endpoint that expects a `city` query parameter.

```typescript filename="src/server.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import "dotenv/config";
import express, { Request, Response } from "express";

import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT ?? 3000;

app.get("/api/weather", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { city } = req.query as { city?: string };

  if (!city) {
    return res.status(400).send("Missing 'city' query parameter");
  }

  const agent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");

  try {
    const result = await agent.generate(`What's the weather like in ${city}?`);
    res.send(result.text);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Agent error:", error);
    res.status(500).send("An error occurred while processing your request");
  }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

With the Mastra dev server running, start your Express app separately. For example:

```bash copy
npx tsx --watch src/server.ts --watch-dir src
```

You can now make a request to the endpoint using one of the following:

<Tabs items={["http", "curl"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    http://localhost:3000/api/weather?city=London
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    curl "http://localhost:3000/api/weather?city=London"
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You should see output similar to the below:

```plaintext
The current weather in London is as follows:

- **Temperature:** 12.9°C (Feels like 9.7°C)
- **Humidity:** 63%
- **Wind Speed:** 14.7 km/h
- **Wind Gusts:** 32.4 km/h
- **Conditions:** Overcast

Let me know if you need more information!
```

</Steps>

import { Tabs, Tab } from "@/components/tabs";

# Install Mastra
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/getting-started/installation

To get started with Mastra, you’ll need access to a large language model (LLM). By default, Mastra is set up to work with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), so you’ll need an API key to begin.

Mastra also supports other LLM providers. For a full list of supported models and setup instructions, see [Model Providers](/docs/getting-started/model-providers).


## Prerequisites

- Node.js `v20.0` or higher
- An API key from a supported [Model Provider](/docs/getting-started/model-providers)

<Steps>

## Install using the `create-mastra` CLI

Our CLI is the fastest way to get started with Mastra. Run the following command to start the interactive setup:

{/*
LLM CONTEXT: This Tabs component shows different package manager commands for creating a new Mastra project.
Each tab displays the equivalent command for that specific package manager (npx, npm, yarn, pnpm, bun).
This helps users choose their preferred package manager while following the same installation process.
All commands achieve the same result - creating a new Mastra project with the interactive setup.
*/}

<Tabs items={["npx", "npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npx create-mastra@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm create mastra@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn create mastra@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm create mastra@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    bun create mastra@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


**Install using CLI flags**

You can also run the Mastra CLI in non-interactive mode by passing all required flags, for example:

```bash copy
npx create-mastra@latest --project-name hello-mastra --example --components tools,agents,workflows --llm openai
```

> See the [create-mastra](/reference/cli/create-mastra) documentation for a full list of available CLI options.

### Add your API key

Add your API key to the `.env` file:

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```
> This example uses OpenAI. Each LLM provider uses a unique name. See [Model Capabilities](/docs/getting-started/model-capability) for more information.

You can now launch the [Mastra Development Server](/docs/server-db/local-dev-playground) and test your agent using the Mastra Playground.

</Steps>

## Install manually

The following steps will walk you through installing Mastra manually.

<Steps>

### Create a new project

Create a new project and change directory:

```bash copy
mkdir hello-mastra && cd hello-mastra
```

Initialize a TypeScript project including the `@mastra/core` package:

{/*
LLM CONTEXT: This Tabs component shows manual installation commands for different package managers.
Each tab displays the complete setup process for that package manager including project initialization,
dev dependencies installation, and core Mastra packages installation.
This helps users manually set up a Mastra project with their preferred package manager.
*/}

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}>

  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm init -y

    npm install typescript tsx @types/node mastra@latest --save-dev

    npm install @mastra/core@latest zod@^3 @ai-sdk/openai
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm init

    pnpm add typescript tsx @types/node mastra@latest --save-dev

    pnpm add @mastra/core@latest zod@^3 @ai-sdk/openai
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn init -y

    yarn add typescript tsx @types/node mastra@latest --dev

    yarn add @mastra/core@latest zod@^3 @ai-sdk/openai
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    bun init -y

    bun add typescript tsx @types/node mastra@latest --dev

    bun add @mastra/core@latest zod@^3 @ai-sdk/openai
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Add the `dev` and `build` scripts to `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "dev": "mastra dev",
    "build": "mastra build"
  }
}
```

### Initialize TypeScript

Create a `tsconfig.json` file:

```bash copy
touch tsconfig.json
```

Add the following configuration:

```json filename="tsconfig.json" copy
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ES2022",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*"
  ]
}
```

> This TypeScript configuration is optimized for Mastra projects, using modern module resolution and strict type checking.

### Set up your API key

Create `.env` file:

```bash copy
touch .env
```

Add your API key:

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

> This example uses OpenAI. Each LLM provider uses a unique name. See [Model Capabilities](/docs/getting-started/model-capability) for more information.

### Create a Tool

Create a `weather-tool.ts` file:

```bash copy
mkdir -p src/mastra/tools && touch src/mastra/tools/weather-tool.ts
```

Add the following code:

```ts filename="src/mastra/tools/weather-tool.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "get-weather",
  description: "Get current weather for a location",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("City name")
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  }),
  execute: async () => {
    return {
      output: "The weather is sunny"
    };
  }
});
```

> See the full weatherTool example in [Giving an Agent a Tool](/examples/agents/using-a-tool).

### Create an Agent

Create a `weather-agent.ts` file:

```bash copy
mkdir -p src/mastra/agents && touch src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts
```

Add the following code:

```ts filename="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { weatherTool } from "../tools/weather-tool";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Weather Agent',
  instructions: `
      You are a helpful weather assistant that provides accurate weather information.

      Your primary function is to help users get weather details for specific locations. When responding:
      - Always ask for a location if none is provided
      - If the location name isn’t in English, please translate it
      - If giving a location with multiple parts (e.g. "New York, NY"), use the most relevant part (e.g. "New York")
      - Include relevant details like humidity, wind conditions, and precipitation
      - Keep responses concise but informative

      Use the weatherTool to fetch current weather data.
`,
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
  tools: { weatherTool }
});
```

### Register the Agent

Create the Mastra entry point and register agent:

```bash copy
touch src/mastra/index.ts
```

Add the following code:

```ts filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weather-agent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent }
});
```

You can now launch the [Mastra Development Server](/docs/server-db/local-dev-playground) and test your agent using the Mastra Playground.

</Steps>

description: "Learn how to configure and use different model providers with Mastra."
---

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

# Model Providers
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/getting-started/model-providers

Model providers are used to interact with different language models. Mastra uses [Vercel's AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai) as a model routing layer to provide a similar syntax for many models:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy {1,7} filename="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "WeatherAgent",
  instructions: "Instructions for the agent...",
  model: openai("gpt-4-turbo"),
});

const result = await agent.generate("What is the weather like?");
```

## Types of AI SDK model providers

Model providers from the AI SDK can be grouped into three main categories:

- [Official providers maintained by the AI SDK team](/docs/getting-started/model-providers#official-providers)
- [OpenAI-compatible providers](/docs/getting-started/model-providers#openai-compatible-providers)
- [Community providers](/docs/getting-started/model-providers#community-providers)

> You can find a list of all available model providers in the [AI SDK documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers).

<Callout>
AI SDK model providers are packages that need to be installed in your Mastra project.
The default model provider selected during the installation process is installed in the project.

If you want to use a different model provider, you need to install it in your project as well.
</Callout>

Here are some examples of how Mastra agents can be configured to use the different types of model providers:

### Official providers

Official model providers are maintained by the AI SDK team.
Their packages are usually prefixed with `@ai-sdk/`, e.g. `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/openai`, etc.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy {1,7} filename="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "WeatherAgent",
  instructions: "Instructions for the agent...",
  model: openai("gpt-4-turbo"),
});
```

Additional configuration may be done by importing a helper function from the AI SDK provider.
Here's an example using the OpenAI provider:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts" {1,4-8,13}
import { createOpenAI } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent"

const openai = createOpenAI({
    baseUrl: "<your-custom-base-url>",
    apiKey: "<your-custom-api-key>",
    ...otherOptions
});

const agent = new Agent({
    name: "WeatherAgent",
    instructions: "Instructions for the agent...",
    model: openai("<model-name>"),
});
```

### OpenAI-compatible providers

Some language model providers implement the OpenAI API. For these providers, you can use the [`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ai-sdk/openai-compatible) provider.

Here's the general setup and provider instance creation:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts" {1,4-14,19}
import { createOpenAICompatible } from "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

const openaiCompatible = createOpenAICompatible({
    name: "<model-name>",
    baseUrl: "<base-url>",
    apiKey: "<api-key>",
    headers: {},
    queryParams: {},
    fetch: async (url, options) => {
        // custom fetch logic
        return fetch(url, options);
    }
});

const agent = new Agent({
    name: "WeatherAgent",
    instructions: "Instructions for the agent...",
    model: openaiCompatible("<model-name>"),
});
```

For more information on the OpenAI-compatible provider, please refer to the [AI SDK documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/openai-compatible-providers).

### Community providers

The AI SDK provides a [Language Model Specification](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/provider/src/language-model/v1).
Following this specification, you can create your own model provider compatible with the AI SDK.

Some community providers have implemented this specification and are compatible with the AI SDK.
We will look at one such provider, the Ollama provider available in the [`ollama-ai-provider`](https://github.com/sgomez/ollama-ai-provider) package.

Here's an example:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts" {1,7}
import { ollama } from "ollama-ai-provider";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

const agent = new Agent({
    name: "WeatherAgent",
    instructions: "Instructions for the agent...",
    model: ollama("llama3.2:latest"),
});
```

You can also configure the Ollama provider like so:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts" {1,4-7,12}
import { createOllama } from "ollama-ai-provider";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

const ollama = createOllama({
    baseUrl: "<your-custom-base-url>",
    ...otherOptions,
});

const agent = new Agent({
    name: "WeatherAgent",
    instructions: "Instructions for the agent...",
    model: ollama("llama3.2:latest"),
});
```

For more information on the Ollama provider and other available community providers, please refer to the [AI SDK documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/community-providers).

<Callout>
While this example shows how to use the Ollama provider, other providers like `openrouter`, `azure`, etc. may also be used.
</Callout>

Different AI providers may have different options for configuration. Please refer to the [AI SDK documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) for more information.

# Project Structure
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/getting-started/project-structure

This page provides a guide for organizing folders and files in Mastra. Mastra is a modular framework, and you can use any of the modules separately or together.

You could write everything in a single file, or separate each agent, tool, and workflow into their own files.

We don't enforce a specific folder structure, but we do recommend some best practices, and the CLI will scaffold a project with a sensible structure.

## Example Project Structure

A default project created with the CLI looks like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="agents" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="agent-name.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="tools" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="tool-name.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="workflows" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="workflow-name.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name=".env" />
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
</FileTree>

---

# About Mastra
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs

Mastra is an open-source TypeScript agent framework.

It's designed to give you the primitives you need to build AI applications and features.

You can use Mastra to build [AI agents](/docs/agents/overview.mdx) that have memory and can execute functions, or chain LLM calls in deterministic [workflows](/docs/workflows/overview.mdx). You can chat with your agents in Mastra's [local dev environment](/docs/local-dev/mastra-dev.mdx), feed them application-specific knowledge with [RAG](/docs/rag/overview.mdx), and score their outputs with Mastra's [evals](/docs/evals/overview.mdx).

The main features include:

- **[Model routing](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction)**: Mastra uses the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) for model routing, providing a unified interface to interact with any LLM provider including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini.
- **[Agent memory and tool calling](/docs/agents/agent-memory.mdx)**: With Mastra, you can give your agent tools (functions) that it can call. You can persist agent memory and retrieve it based on recency, semantic similarity, or conversation thread.
- **[Workflow graphs](/docs/workflows/overview.mdx)**: When you want to execute LLM calls in a deterministic way, Mastra gives you a graph-based workflow engine. You can define discrete steps, log inputs and outputs at each step of each run, and pipe them into an observability tool. Mastra workflows have a simple syntax for control flow (`.then()`, `.branch()`, `.parallel()`) that allows branching and chaining.
- **[Agent development environment](/docs/local-dev/mastra-dev.mdx)**: When you're developing an agent locally, you can chat with it and see its state and memory in Mastra's agent development environment.
- **[Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/docs/rag/overview.mdx)**: Mastra gives you APIs to process documents (text, HTML, Markdown, JSON) into chunks, create embeddings, and store them in a vector database. At query time, it retrieves relevant chunks to ground LLM responses in your data, with a unified API on top of multiple vector stores (Pinecone, pgvector, etc) and embedding providers (OpenAI, Cohere, etc).
- **[Deployment](/docs/deployment/deployment.mdx)**: Mastra supports bundling your agents and workflows within an existing React, Next.js, or Node.js application, or into standalone endpoints. The Mastra deploy helper lets you easily bundle agents and workflows into a Node.js server using Hono, or deploy it onto a serverless platform like Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, or Netlify.
- **[Evals](/docs/evals/overview.mdx)**: Mastra provides automated evaluation metrics that use model-graded, rule-based, and statistical methods to assess LLM outputs, with built-in metrics for toxicity, bias, relevance, and factual accuracy. You can also define your own evals.

import Image from "next/image";

# Logging
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/observability/logging

In Mastra, logs can detail when certain functions run, what input data they receive, and how they respond.

## Basic Setup

Here's a minimal example that sets up a **console logger** at the `INFO` level. This will print out informational messages and above (i.e., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) to the console.

```typescript filename="mastra.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // Other Mastra configuration...
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});
```

In this configuration:

- `name: "Mastra"` specifies the name to group logs under.
- `level: "info"` sets the minimum severity of logs to record.

## Configuration

- For more details on the options you can pass to `PinoLogger()`, see the [PinoLogger reference documentation](/reference/observability/logger).
- Once you have a `Logger` instance, you can call its methods (e.g., `.info()`, `.warn()`, `.error()`) in the [Logger instance reference documentation](/reference/observability/logger).
- If you want to send your logs to an external service for centralized collection, analysis, or storage, you can configure other logger types such as Upstash Redis. Consult the [Logger reference documentation](/reference/observability/logger) for details on parameters like `url`, `token`, and `key` when using the `UPSTASH` logger type.

title: "Next.js Tracing | Mastra Observability Documentation"
description: "Set up OpenTelemetry tracing for Next.js applications"
---

# Next.js Tracing
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/observability/nextjs-tracing

Next.js requires additional configuration to enable OpenTelemetry tracing.

### Step 1: Next.js Configuration

Start by enabling the instrumentation hook in your Next.js config:

```ts filename="next.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    instrumentationHook: true, // Not required in Next.js 15+
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

### Step 2: Mastra Configuration

Configure your Mastra instance:

```typescript filename="mastra.config.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "your-project-name",
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

### Step 3: Configure your providers

If you're using Next.js, you have two options for setting up OpenTelemetry instrumentation:

#### Option 1: Using a Custom Exporter

The default that will work across providers is to configure a custom exporter:

1. Install the required dependencies (example using Langfuse):

```bash copy
npm install @opentelemetry/api langfuse-vercel
```

2. Create an instrumentation file:

```ts filename="instrumentation.ts" copy
import {
  NodeSDK,
  ATTR_SERVICE_NAME,
  resourceFromAttributes,
} from "@mastra/core/telemetry/otel-vendor";
import { LangfuseExporter } from "langfuse-vercel";

export function register() {
  const exporter = new LangfuseExporter({
    // ... Langfuse config
  });

  const sdk = new NodeSDK({
    resource: resourceFromAttributes({
      [ATTR_SERVICE_NAME]: "ai",
    }),
    traceExporter: exporter,
  });

  sdk.start();
}
```

#### Option 2: Using Vercel's Otel Setup

If you're deploying to Vercel, you can use their OpenTelemetry setup:

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash copy
npm install @opentelemetry/api @vercel/otel
```

2. Create an instrumentation file at the root of your project (or in the src folder if using one):

```ts filename="instrumentation.ts" copy
import { registerOTel } from "@vercel/otel";

export function register() {
  registerOTel({ serviceName: "your-project-name" });
}
```

### Summary

This setup will enable OpenTelemetry tracing for your Next.js application and Mastra operations.

For more details, see the documentation for:

- [Next.js Instrumentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation)
- [Vercel OpenTelemetry](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/otel-overview/quickstart)

description: "Set up OpenTelemetry tracing for Mastra applications"

import Image from "next/image";

# Tracing
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/observability/tracing

Mastra supports the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for tracing and monitoring your application. When telemetry is enabled, Mastra automatically traces all core primitives including agent operations, LLM interactions, tool executions, integration calls, workflow runs, and database operations. Your telemetry data can then be exported to any OTEL collector.

### Basic Configuration

Here's a simple example of enabling telemetry:

```ts filename="mastra.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "my-app",
    enabled: true,
    sampling: {
      type: "always_on",
    },
    export: {
      type: "otlp",
      endpoint: "http://localhost:4318", // SigNoz local endpoint
    },
  },
});
```

### Configuration Options

The telemetry config accepts these properties:

```ts
type OtelConfig = {
  // Name to identify your service in traces (optional)
  serviceName?: string;

  // Enable/disable telemetry (defaults to true)
  enabled?: boolean;

  // Control how many traces are sampled
  sampling?: {
    type: "ratio" | "always_on" | "always_off" | "parent_based";
    probability?: number; // For ratio sampling
    root?: {
      probability: number; // For parent_based sampling
    };
  };

  // Where to send telemetry data
  export?: {
    type: "otlp" | "console";
    endpoint?: string;
    headers?: Record<string, string>;
  };
};
```

See the [OtelConfig reference documentation](../../reference/observability/otel-config.mdx) for more details.

### Environment Variables

You can configure the OTLP endpoint and headers through environment variables:

```env filename=".env" copy
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-api-key=your-api-key
```

Then in your config:

```ts filename="mastra.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "my-app",
    enabled: true,
    export: {
      type: "otlp",
      // endpoint and headers will be picked up from env vars
    },
  },
});
```

### Example: SigNoz Integration

Here's what a traced agent interaction looks like in [SigNoz](https://signoz.io):

<img
  src="/image/signoz-telemetry-demo.png"
  alt="Agent interaction trace showing spans, LLM calls, and tool executions"
  style={{ maxWidth: "800px", width: "100%", margin: "8px 0" }}
  className="nextra-image rounded-md"
  data-zoom
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

### Other Supported Providers

For a complete list of supported observability providers and their configuration details, see the [Observability Providers reference](../../reference/observability/providers/).

### Custom Instrumentation files

You can define custom instrumentation files in your Mastra project by placing them in the `/mastra` folder. Mastra automatically detects and bundles these files instead of using the default instrumentation.

#### Supported File Types

Mastra looks for instrumentation files with these extensions:
- `instrumentation.js`
- `instrumentation.ts` 
- `instrumentation.mjs`

#### Example

```ts filename="/mastra/instrumentation.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node';
import { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } from '@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node';
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http';

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: 'http://localhost:4318/v1/traces',
  }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
});

sdk.start();
```

When Mastra finds a custom instrumentation file, it automatically replaces the default instrumentation and bundles it during the build process.

### Next.js-specific Tracing steps

If you're using Next.js, you have three additional configuration steps:

1. Enable the instrumentation hook in `next.config.ts`
2. Configure Mastra telemetry settings
3. Set up an OpenTelemetry exporter

For implementation details, see the [Next.js Tracing](./nextjs-tracing) guide.

## Chunking and Embedding Documents
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/rag/chunking-and-embedding

Before processing, create a MDocument instance from your content. You can initialize it from various formats:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const docFromText = MDocument.fromText("Your plain text content...");
const docFromHTML = MDocument.fromHTML("<html>Your HTML content...</html>");
const docFromMarkdown = MDocument.fromMarkdown("# Your Markdown content...");
const docFromJSON = MDocument.fromJSON(`{ "key": "value" }`);
```

## Step 1: Document Processing

Use `chunk` to split documents into manageable pieces. Mastra supports multiple chunking strategies optimized for different document types:

- `recursive`: Smart splitting based on content structure
- `character`: Simple character-based splits
- `token`: Token-aware splitting
- `markdown`: Markdown-aware splitting
- `html`: HTML structure-aware splitting
- `json`: JSON structure-aware splitting
- `latex`: LaTeX structure-aware splitting

Here's an example of how to use the `recursive` strategy:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 512,
  overlap: 50,
  separator: "\n",
  extract: {
    metadata: true, // Optionally extract metadata
  },
});
```

**Note:** Metadata extraction may use LLM calls, so ensure your API key is set.

We go deeper into chunking strategies in our [chunk documentation](/reference/rag/chunk.mdx).

## Step 2: Embedding Generation

Transform chunks into embeddings using your preferred provider. Mastra supports many embedding providers, including OpenAI and Cohere:

### Using OpenAI

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { embedMany } from "ai";

const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});
```

### Using Cohere

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { cohere } from "@ai-sdk/cohere";
import { embedMany } from "ai";

const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: cohere.embedding("embed-english-v3.0"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});
```

The embedding functions return vectors, arrays of numbers representing the semantic meaning of your text, ready for similarity searches in your vector database.

### Configuring Embedding Dimensions

Embedding models typically output vectors with a fixed number of dimensions (e.g., 1536 for OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`).
Some models support reducing this dimensionality, which can help:

- Decrease storage requirements in vector databases
- Reduce computational costs for similarity searches

Here are some supported models:

OpenAI (text-embedding-3 models):

```ts
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small", {
    dimensions: 256, // Only supported in text-embedding-3 and later
  }),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});
```

Google (text-embedding-004):

```ts
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: google.textEmbeddingModel("text-embedding-004", {
    outputDimensionality: 256, // Truncates excessive values from the end
  }),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});
```

### Vector Database Compatibility

When storing embeddings, the vector database index must be configured to match the output size of your embedding model. If the dimensions do not match, you may get errors or data corruption.

## Example: Complete Pipeline

Here's an example showing document processing and embedding generation with both providers:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { embedMany } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { cohere } from "@ai-sdk/cohere";

import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";

// Initialize document
const doc = MDocument.fromText(`
  Climate change poses significant challenges to global agriculture.
  Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns affect crop yields.
`);

// Create chunks
const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 256,
  overlap: 50,
});

// Generate embeddings with OpenAI
const { embeddings: openAIEmbeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});

// OR

// Generate embeddings with Cohere
const { embeddings: cohereEmbeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: cohere.embedding("embed-english-v3.0"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});

// Store embeddings in your vector database
await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: embeddings,
});
```

title: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in Mastra | Mastra Docs
description: Overview of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Mastra, detailing its capabilities for enhancing LLM outputs with relevant context.

# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in Mastra
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/rag/overview

RAG in Mastra helps you enhance LLM outputs by incorporating relevant context from your own data sources, improving accuracy and grounding responses in real information.

Mastra's RAG system provides:

- Standardized APIs to process and embed documents
- Support for multiple vector stores
- Chunking and embedding strategies for optimal retrieval
- Observability for tracking embedding and retrieval performance

## Example

To implement RAG, you process your documents into chunks, create embeddings, store them in a vector database, and then retrieve relevant context at query time.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { embedMany } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";
import { z } from "zod";

// 1. Initialize document
const doc = MDocument.fromText(`Your document text here...`);

// 2. Create chunks
const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 512,
  overlap: 50,
});

// 3. Generate embeddings; we need to pass the text of each chunk
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});

// 4. Store in vector database
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING,
});
await pgVector.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: embeddings,
}); // using an index name of 'embeddings'

// 5. Query similar chunks
const results = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: queryVector,
  topK: 3,
}); // queryVector is the embedding of the query

console.log("Similar chunks:", results);
```

This example shows the essentials: initialize a document, create chunks, generate embeddings, store them, and query for similar content.

## Document Processing

The basic building block of RAG is document processing. Documents can be chunked using various strategies (recursive, sliding window, etc.) and enriched with metadata. See the [chunking and embedding doc](./chunking-and-embedding.mdx).

## Vector Storage

Mastra supports multiple vector stores for embedding persistence and similarity search, including pgvector, Pinecone, Qdrant, and MongoDB. See the [vector database doc](./vector-databases.mdx).

## Observability and Debugging

Mastra's RAG system includes observability features to help you optimize your retrieval pipeline:

- Track embedding generation performance and costs
- Monitor chunk quality and retrieval relevance
- Analyze query patterns and cache hit rates
- Export metrics to your observability platform

See the [OTel Configuration](../../reference/observability/otel-config.mdx) page for more details.

## Retrieval in RAG Systems
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/rag/retrieval

After storing embeddings, you need to retrieve relevant chunks to answer user queries.

Mastra provides flexible retrieval options with support for semantic search, filtering, and re-ranking.

## How Retrieval Works

1. The user's query is converted to an embedding using the same model used for document embeddings
2. This embedding is compared to stored embeddings using vector similarity
3. The most similar chunks are retrieved and can be optionally:

- Filtered by metadata
- Re-ranked for better relevance
- Processed through a knowledge graph

## Basic Retrieval

The simplest approach is direct semantic search. This method uses vector similarity to find chunks that are semantically similar to the query:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { embed } from "ai";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";

// Convert query to embedding
const { embedding } = await embed({
  value: "What are the main points in the article?",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});

// Query vector store
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING,
});
const results = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: embedding,
  topK: 10,
});

// Display results
console.log(results);
```

Results include both the text content and a similarity score:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
[
  {
    text: "Climate change poses significant challenges...",
    score: 0.89,
    metadata: { source: "article1.txt" },
  },
  {
    text: "Rising temperatures affect crop yields...",
    score: 0.82,
    metadata: { source: "article1.txt" },
  },
  // ... more results
];
```

For an example of how to use the basic retrieval method, see the [Retrieve Results](../../examples/rag/query/retrieve-results.mdx) example.

## Advanced Retrieval options

### Metadata Filtering

Filter results based on metadata fields to narrow down the search space. This is useful when you have documents from different sources, time periods, or with specific attributes. Mastra provides a unified MongoDB-style query syntax that works across all supported vector stores.

For detailed information about available operators and syntax, see the [Metadata Filters Reference](/reference/rag/metadata-filters).

Basic filtering examples:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Simple equality filter
const results = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: embedding,
  topK: 10,
  filter: {
    source: "article1.txt",
  },
});

// Numeric comparison
const results = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: embedding,
  topK: 10,
  filter: {
    price: { $gt: 100 },
  },
});

// Multiple conditions
const results = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: embedding,
  topK: 10,
  filter: {
    category: "electronics",
    price: { $lt: 1000 },
    inStock: true,
  },
});

// Array operations
const results = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: embedding,
  topK: 10,
  filter: {
    tags: { $in: ["sale", "new"] },
  },
});

// Logical operators
const results = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: embedding,
  topK: 10,
  filter: {
    $or: [{ category: "electronics" }, { category: "accessories" }],
    $and: [{ price: { $gt: 50 } }, { price: { $lt: 200 } }],
  },
});
```

Common use cases for metadata filtering:

- Filter by document source or type
- Filter by date ranges
- Filter by specific categories or tags
- Filter by numerical ranges (e.g., price, rating)
- Combine multiple conditions for precise querying
- Filter by document attributes (e.g., language, author)

For an example of how to use metadata filtering, see the [Hybrid Vector Search](../../examples/rag/query/hybrid-vector-search.mdx) example.

### Vector Query Tool

Sometimes you want to give your agent the ability to query a vector database directly. The Vector Query Tool allows your agent to be in charge of retrieval decisions, combining semantic search with optional filtering and reranking based on the agent's understanding of the user's needs.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const vectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "embeddings",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});
```

When creating the tool, pay special attention to the tool's name and description - these help the agent understand when and how to use the retrieval capabilities. For example, you might name it "SearchKnowledgeBase" and describe it as "Search through our documentation to find relevant information about X topic."

This is particularly useful when:

- Your agent needs to dynamically decide what information to retrieve
- The retrieval process requires complex decision-making
- You want the agent to combine multiple retrieval strategies based on context

#### Database-Specific Configurations

The Vector Query Tool supports database-specific configurations that enable you to leverage unique features and optimizations of different vector stores:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Pinecone with namespace
const pineconeQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  databaseConfig: {
    pinecone: {
      namespace: "production"  // Isolate data by environment
    }
  }
});

// pgVector with performance tuning
const pgVectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "postgres",
  indexName: "embeddings", 
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  databaseConfig: {
    pgvector: {
      minScore: 0.7,    // Filter low-quality results
      ef: 200,          // HNSW search parameter
      probes: 10        // IVFFlat probe parameter
    }
  }
});

// Chroma with advanced filtering
const chromaQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "chroma",
  indexName: "documents",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  databaseConfig: {
    chroma: {
      where: { "category": "technical" },
      whereDocument: { "$contains": "API" }
    }
  }
});

// LanceDB with table specificity
const lanceQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "lance",
  indexName: "documents",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  databaseConfig: {
    lance: {
      tableName: "myVectors",     // Specify which table to query
      includeAllColumns: true     // Include all metadata columns in results
    }
  }
});
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Pinecone namespaces**: Organize vectors by tenant, environment, or data type
- **pgVector optimization**: Control search accuracy and speed with ef/probes parameters
- **Quality filtering**: Set minimum similarity thresholds to improve result relevance
- **LanceDB tables**: Separate data into tables for better organization and performance
- **Runtime flexibility**: Override configurations dynamically based on context

**Common Use Cases:**
- Multi-tenant applications using Pinecone namespaces
- Performance optimization in high-load scenarios
- Environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod)
- Quality-gated search results
- Embedded, file-based vector storage with LanceDB for edge deployment scenarios

You can also override these configurations at runtime using the runtime context:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { RuntimeContext } from '@mastra/core/runtime-context';

const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
runtimeContext.set('databaseConfig', {
  pinecone: {
    namespace: 'runtime-namespace'
  }
});

await pineconeQueryTool.execute({
  context: { queryText: 'search query' },
  mastra,
  runtimeContext
});
```

For detailed configuration options and advanced usage, see the [Vector Query Tool Reference](/reference/tools/vector-query-tool).

### Vector Store Prompts

Vector store prompts define query patterns and filtering capabilities for each vector database implementation.
When implementing filtering, these prompts are required in the agent's instructions to specify valid operators and syntax for each vector store implementation.

{/*

### Re-ranking

Initial vector similarity search can sometimes miss nuanced relevance. Re-ranking is a more computationally expensive process, but more accurate algorithm that improves results by:

- Considering word order and exact matches
- Applying more sophisticated relevance scoring
- Using a method called cross-attention between query and documents

Here's how to use re-ranking:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { 
  rerankWithScorer as rerank, 
  MastraAgentRelevanceScorer 
} from "@mastra/rag";

// Get initial results from vector search
const initialResults = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: queryEmbedding,
  topK: 10,
});

// Create a relevance scorer
const relevanceProvider = new MastraAgentRelevanceScorer('relevance-scorer', openai("gpt-4o-mini"));

// Re-rank the results
const rerankedResults = await rerank({
  results: initialResults,
  query,
  provider: relevanceProvider,
  options: {
    topK: 10,
  },
);
```

> **Note:** For semantic scoring to work properly during re-ranking, each result must include the text content in its `metadata.text` field.

You can also use other relevance score providers like Cohere or ZeroEntropy:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const relevanceProvider = new CohereRelevanceScorer('rerank-v3.5');
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const relevanceProvider = new ZeroEntropyRelevanceScorer('zerank-1');
```

The re-ranked results combine vector similarity with semantic understanding to improve retrieval quality.

For more details about re-ranking, see the [rerank()](/reference/rag/rerankWithScorer) method.

For an example of how to use the re-ranking method, see the [Re-ranking Results](../../examples/rag/rerank/rerank.mdx) example.

### Graph-based Retrieval

For documents with complex relationships, graph-based retrieval can follow connections between chunks. This helps when:

- Information is spread across multiple documents
- Documents reference each other
- You need to traverse relationships to find complete answers

Example setup:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const graphQueryTool = createGraphQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "embeddings",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  graphOptions: {
    threshold: 0.7,
  },
});
```

For more details about graph-based retrieval, see the [GraphRAG](/reference/rag/graph-rag) class and the [createGraphQueryTool()](/reference/tools/graph-rag-tool) function.

For an example of how to use the graph-based retrieval method, see the [Graph-based Retrieval](../../examples/rag/usage/graph-rag.mdx) example.

## Storing Embeddings in A Vector Database
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/rag/vector-databases

After generating embeddings, you need to store them in a database that supports vector similarity search. Mastra provides a consistent interface for storing and querying embeddings across various vector databases.

## Supported Databases

{/*
LLM CONTEXT: This Tabs component showcases different vector database implementations supported by Mastra.
Each tab demonstrates the setup and configuration for a specific vector database provider.
The tabs show consistent API patterns across different databases, helping users understand how to switch between providers.
Each tab includes import statements, initialization code, and basic operations (createIndex, upsert) for that specific database.
The providers include Pg Vector, Pinecone, Qdrant, Chroma, Astra, LibSQL, Upstash, Cloudflare, MongoDB, OpenSearch, and Couchbase.

  ### Using LanceDB
  
  LanceDB is an embedded vector database built on the Lance columnar format, suitable for local development or cloud deployment.
  For detailed setup instructions and best practices, see the [official LanceDB documentation](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/).

## Using Vector Storage

Once initialized, all vector stores share the same interface for creating indexes, upserting embeddings, and querying.

### Creating Indexes

Before storing embeddings, you need to create an index with the appropriate dimension size for your embedding model:

```ts filename="store-embeddings.ts" showLineNumbers copy
// Create an index with dimension 1536 (for text-embedding-3-small)
await store.createIndex({
  indexName: "myCollection",
  dimension: 1536,
});
```

The dimension size must match the output dimension of your chosen embedding model. Common dimension sizes are:

- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small: 1536 dimensions (or custom, e.g., 256)
- Cohere embed-multilingual-v3: 1024 dimensions
- Google `text-embedding-004`: 768 dimensions (or custom)

> **Important**: Index dimensions cannot be changed after creation. To use a different model, delete and recreate the index with the new dimension size.

### Naming Rules for Databases

Each vector database enforces specific naming conventions for indexes and collections to ensure compatibility and prevent conflicts.

{/*
LLM CONTEXT: This Tabs component displays naming convention rules for different vector databases.

### Upserting Embeddings

After creating an index, you can store embeddings along with their basic metadata:

```ts filename="store-embeddings.ts" showLineNumbers copy
// Store embeddings with their corresponding metadata
await store.upsert({
  indexName: "myCollection", // index name
  vectors: embeddings, // array of embedding vectors
  metadata: chunks.map((chunk) => ({
    text: chunk.text, // The original text content
    id: chunk.id, // Optional unique identifier
  })),
});
```

The upsert operation:

- Takes an array of embedding vectors and their corresponding metadata
- Updates existing vectors if they share the same ID
- Creates new vectors if they don't exist
- Automatically handles batching for large datasets

For complete examples of upserting embeddings in different vector stores, see the [Upsert Embeddings](../../examples/rag/upsert/upsert-embeddings.mdx) guide.

## Adding Metadata

Vector stores support rich metadata (any JSON-serializable fields) for filtering and organization. Since metadata is stored with no fixed schema, use consistent field naming to avoid unexpected query results.

**Important**: Metadata is crucial for vector storage - without it, you'd only have numerical embeddings with no way to return the original text or filter results. Always store at least the source text as metadata.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Store embeddings with rich metadata for better organization and filtering
await store.upsert({
  indexName: "myCollection",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks.map((chunk) => ({
    // Basic content
    text: chunk.text,
    id: chunk.id,

    // Document organization
    source: chunk.source,
    category: chunk.category,

    // Temporal metadata
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    version: "1.0",

    // Custom fields
    language: chunk.language,
    author: chunk.author,
    confidenceScore: chunk.score,
  })),
});
```

Key metadata considerations:

- Be strict with field naming - inconsistencies like 'category' vs 'Category' will affect queries
- Only include fields you plan to filter or sort by - extra fields add overhead
- Add timestamps (e.g., 'createdAt', 'lastUpdated') to track content freshness

## Best Practices

- Create indexes before bulk insertions
- Use batch operations for large insertions (the upsert method handles batching automatically)
- Only store metadata you'll query against
- Match embedding dimensions to your model (e.g., 1536 for `text-embedding-3-small`)

# Advanced Tool Usage
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/tools-mcp/advanced-usage

This page covers more advanced techniques and features related to using tools in Mastra.

## Abort Signals

When you initiate an agent interaction using `generate()` or `stream()`, you can provide an `AbortSignal`. Mastra automatically forwards this signal to any tool executions that occur during that interaction.

This allows you to cancel long-running operations within your tools, such as network requests or intensive computations, if the parent agent call is aborted.

You access the `abortSignal` in the second parameter of the tool's `execute` function.

```typescript
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const longRunningTool = createTool({
  id: "long-computation",
  description: "Performs a potentially long computation",
  inputSchema: z.object({ /* ... */ }),
  execute: async ({ context }, { abortSignal }) => {
    // Example: Forwarding signal to fetch
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
      signal: abortSignal, // Pass the signal here
    });

    if (abortSignal?.aborted) {
      console.log("Tool execution aborted.");
      throw new Error("Aborted");
    }

    // Example: Checking signal during a loop
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
      if (abortSignal?.aborted) {
        console.log("Tool execution aborted during loop.");
        throw new Error("Aborted");
      }
      // ... perform computation step ...
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    return { result: data };
  },\n});
```

To use this, provide an `AbortController`'s signal when calling the agent:

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
// Assume 'agent' is an Agent instance with longRunningTool configured

const controller = new AbortController();

// Start the agent call
const promise = agent.generate("Perform the long computation.", {
  abortSignal: controller.signal,
});

// Sometime later, if needed:
// controller.abort();

try {
  const result = await promise;
  console.log(result.text);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.name === "AbortError") {
    console.log("Agent generation was aborted.");
  } else {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error);
  }
}
```

## AI SDK Tool Format

Mastra maintains compatibility with the tool format used by the Vercel AI SDK (`ai` package). You can define tools using the `tool` function from the `ai` package and use them directly within your Mastra agents alongside tools created with Mastra's `createTool`.

First, ensure you have the `ai` package installed:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install ai
```

Here's an example of a tool defined using the Vercel AI SDK format:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/vercelWeatherTool.ts" copy
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";

export const vercelWeatherTool = tool({
  description: "Fetches current weather using Vercel AI SDK format",
  parameters: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("The city to get weather for"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ city }) => {
    console.log(`Fetching weather for ${city} (Vercel format tool)`);
    // Replace with actual API call
    const data = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/weather?city=${city}`);
    return data.json();
  },
});
```

You can then add this tool to your Mastra agent just like any other tool:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/mixedToolsAgent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { vercelWeatherTool } from "../tools/vercelWeatherTool"; // Vercel AI SDK tool
import { mastraTool } from "../tools/mastraTool"; // Mastra createTool tool

export const mixedToolsAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Mixed Tools Agent",
  instructions: "You can use tools defined in different formats.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    weatherVercel: vercelWeatherTool,
    someMastraTool: mastraTool,
  },
});
```

Mastra supports both tool formats, allowing you to mix and match as needed.

title: "Dynamic Tool Context | Tools & MCP | Mastra Docs"
description: Learn how to use Mastra's RuntimeContext to provide dynamic, request-specific configuration to tools.
---

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

# Dynamic Tool Context
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/tools-mcp/dynamic-context

Mastra provides `RuntimeContext`, a system based on dependency injection, that allows you to pass dynamic, request-specific configuration to your tools during execution. This is useful when a tool's behavior needs to change based on user identity, request headers, or other runtime factors, without altering the tool's core code.

<Callout>
  **Note:** `RuntimeContext` is primarily used for passing data *into* tool
  executions. It's distinct from agent memory, which handles conversation
  history and state persistence across multiple calls.
</Callout>

## Basic Usage

To use `RuntimeContext`, first define a type structure for your dynamic configuration. Then, create an instance of `RuntimeContext` typed with your definition and set the desired values. Finally, include the `runtimeContext` instance in the options object when calling `agent.generate()` or `agent.stream()`.

```typescript
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/di";
// Assume 'agent' is an already defined Mastra Agent instance

// Define the context type
type WeatherRuntimeContext = {
  "temperature-scale": "celsius" | "fahrenheit";
};

// Instantiate RuntimeContext and set values
const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext<WeatherRuntimeContext>();
runtimeContext.set("temperature-scale", "celsius");

// Pass to agent call
const response = await agent.generate("What's the weather like today?", {
  runtimeContext, // Pass the context here
});

console.log(response.text);
```

## Accessing Context in Tools

Tools receive the `runtimeContext` as part of the second argument to their `execute` function. You can then use the `.get()` method to retrieve values.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/weather-tool.ts"
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";
// Assume WeatherRuntimeContext is defined as above and accessible here

// Dummy fetch function
async function fetchWeather(
  location: string,
  options: { temperatureUnit: "celsius" | "fahrenheit" },
): Promise<any> {
  console.log(`Fetching weather for ${location} in ${options.temperatureUnit}`);
  // Replace with actual API call
  return { temperature: options.temperatureUnit === "celsius" ? 20 : 68 };
}

export const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "getWeather",
  description: "Get the current weather for a location",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("The location to get weather for"),
  }),
  // The tool's execute function receives runtimeContext
  execute: async ({ context, runtimeContext }) => {
    // Type-safe access to runtimeContext variables
    const temperatureUnit = runtimeContext.get("temperature-scale");

    // Use the context value in the tool logic
    const weather = await fetchWeather(context.location, {
      temperatureUnit,
    });

    return {
      result: `The temperature is ${weather.temperature}°${temperatureUnit === "celsius" ? "C" : "F"}`,
    };
  },
});
```

When the agent uses `weatherTool`, the `temperature-scale` value set in the `runtimeContext` during the `agent.generate()` call will be available inside the tool's `execute` function.

## Using with Server Middleware

In server environments (like Express or Next.js), you can use middleware to automatically populate `RuntimeContext` based on incoming request data, such as headers or user sessions.

Here's an example using Mastra's built-in server middleware support (which uses Hono internally) to set the temperature scale based on the Cloudflare `CF-IPCountry` header:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/di";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weather"; // Assume agent is defined elsewhere

// Define RuntimeContext type
type WeatherRuntimeContext = {
  "temperature-scale": "celsius" | "fahrenheit";
};

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: {
    weather: weatherAgent,
  },
  server: {
    middleware: [
      async (c, next) => {
        // Get the RuntimeContext instance
        const runtimeContext =
          c.get<RuntimeContext<WeatherRuntimeContext>>("runtimeContext");

        // Get country code from request header
        const country = c.req.header("CF-IPCountry");

        // Set temperature scale based on country
        runtimeContext.set(
          "temperature-scale",
          country === "US" ? "fahrenheit" : "celsius",
        );

        // Continue request processing
        await next();
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

With this middleware in place, any agent call handled by this Mastra server instance will automatically have the `temperature-scale` set in its `RuntimeContext` based on the user's inferred country, and tools like `weatherTool` will use it accordingly.

title: "MCP Overview | Tools & MCP | Mastra Docs"
description: Learn about the Model Context Protocol (MCP), how to use third-party tools via MCPClient, connect to registries, and share your own tools using MCPServer.
---

import { Tabs } from "nextra/components";

# MCP Overview
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/tools-mcp/mcp-overview

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard designed to let AI models discover and interact with external tools and resources. Think of it as a universal plugin system for AI agents, allowing them to use tools regardless of the language they were written in or where they are hosted.

Mastra uses MCP to connect agents to external tool servers.

## Use third-party tools with an MCP Client

Mastra provides the `MCPClient` class to manage connections to one or more MCP servers and access their tools.

### Installation

If you haven't already, install the Mastra MCP package:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/mcp@latest
```

### Registering the MCPServer

Register your MCP server with Mastra to enable logging and access to configured tools and integrations:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { myMcpServer } from "./mcpServers";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  mcpServers: { myMcpServer },
});
```

### Configuring `MCPClient`

You configure `MCPClient` with a map of servers you want to connect to. It supports connections via subprocess (Stdio) or HTTP (Streamable HTTP with SSE fallback).

```typescript
import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

const mcp = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    // Stdio example
    sequential: {
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
    },
    // HTTP example
    weather: {
      url: new URL("http://localhost:8080/mcp"),
      requestInit: {
        headers: {
          Authorization: "Bearer your-token",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

For detailed configuration options, see the [`MCPClient` reference documentation](/reference/tools/mcp-client).

### Static vs Dynamic Tool Configurations

`MCPClient` offers two approaches to retrieving tools from connected servers, suitable for different application architectures:

| Feature           | Static Configuration (`await mcp.getTools()`) | Dynamic Configuration (`await mcp.getToolsets()`)  |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Case**      | Single-user, static config (e.g., CLI tool)   | Multi-user, dynamic config (e.g., SaaS app)        |
| **Configuration** | Fixed at agent initialization                 | Per-request, dynamic                               |
| **Credentials**   | Shared across all uses                        | Can vary per user/request                          |
| **Agent Setup**   | Tools added in `Agent` constructor            | Tools passed in `generate()` or `stream()` options |

- **Static Configuration (`getTools()`):** Fetches all tools from all configured servers. Best when the tool configuration (like API keys) is static and shared across all users or requests. You typically call this once and pass the result to the `tools` property when defining your `Agent`.
  [Reference: `getTools()`](/reference/tools/mcp-client#gettools)

  ```typescript
  import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
  // ... mcp client setup

  const agent = new Agent({
    // ... other agent config
    tools: await mcp.getTools(),
  });
  ```

- **Dynamic Configuration (`getToolsets()`):** Designed for scenarios where configuration might change per request or per user (e.g., different API keys for different tenants in a multi-user application). You pass the result of `getToolsets()` to the `toolsets` option in the agent's `generate()` or `stream()` method.
  [Reference: `getToolsets()`](/reference/tools/mcp-client#gettoolsets)

  ```typescript
  import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
  // ... agent setup without tools initially

  async function handleRequest(userPrompt: string, userApiKey: string) {
    const userMcp = new MCPClient({
      /* config with userApiKey */
    });
    const toolsets = await userMcp.getToolsets();

    const response = await agent.stream(userPrompt, {
      toolsets, // Pass dynamic toolsets
    });
    // ... handle response
    await userMcp.disconnect();
  }
  ```

## Connecting to an MCP registry

MCP servers can be discovered through registries. Here's how to connect to some popular ones using `MCPClient`:


{/*
LLM CONTEXT: This Tabs component shows how to connect to different MCP (Model Context Protocol) registries.
Each tab demonstrates the configuration for a specific MCP registry service (mcp.run, Composio.dev, Smithery.ai).
The tabs help users understand how to connect to various MCP server providers and their different authentication methods.
Each tab shows the specific URL patterns and configuration needed for that registry service.
*/}

<Tabs items={["mcp.run", "Composio.dev", "Smithery.ai", "Ampersand"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    [mcp.run](https://www.mcp.run/) provides pre-authenticated, managed MCP servers. Tools are grouped into Profiles, each with a unique, signed URL.

    ```typescript
    import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

    const mcp = new MCPClient({
      servers: {
        marketing: { // Example profile name
          url: new URL(process.env.MCP_RUN_SSE_URL!), // Get URL from mcp.run profile
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    > **Important:** Treat the mcp.run SSE URL like a password. Store it securely, for example, in an environment variable.
    > ```bash filename=".env"
    > MCP_RUN_SSE_URL=https://www.mcp.run/api/mcp/sse?nonce=...
    > ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    [Composio.dev](https://composio.dev) offers a registry of [SSE-based MCP servers](https://mcp.composio.dev). You can use the SSE URL generated for tools like Cursor directly.

    ```typescript
    import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

    const mcp = new MCPClient({
      servers: {
        googleSheets: {
          url: new URL("https://mcp.composio.dev/googlesheets/[private-url-path]"),
        },
        gmail: {
          url: new URL("https://mcp.composio.dev/gmail/[private-url-path]"),
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    Authentication with services like Google Sheets often happens interactively through the agent conversation.

    *Note: Composio URLs are typically tied to a single user account, making them best suited for personal automation rather than multi-tenant applications.*

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai) provides a registry accessible via their CLI.

    ```typescript
    // Unix/Mac
    import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

    const mcp = new MCPClient({
      servers: {
        sequentialThinking: {
          command: "npx",
          args: [
            "-y",
            "@smithery/cli@latest",
            "run",
            "@smithery-ai/server-sequential-thinking",
            "--config",
            "{}",
          ],
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    ```typescript
    // Windows
    import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

    const mcp = new MCPClient({
      servers: {
        sequentialThinking: {
          command: "npx",
          args: [
            "-y",
            "@smithery/cli@latest",

            "@smithery-ai/server-sequential-thinking",
            "--config",
            "{}",
          ],
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    [Ampersand](https://withampersand.com?utm_source=mastra-docs) offers an [MCP Server](https://docs.withampersand.com/mcp) that allows you to connect your agent to 150+ integrations with SaaS products like Salesforce, Hubspot, and Zendesk.
    

    ```typescript

    // MCPClient with Ampersand MCP Server using SSE
    export const mcp = new MCPClient({
        servers: {
        "@amp-labs/mcp-server": {
          "url": `https://mcp.withampersand.com/v1/sse?${new URLSearchParams({
            apiKey: process.env.AMPERSAND_API_KEY,
            project: process.env.AMPERSAND_PROJECT_ID,
            integrationName: process.env.AMPERSAND_INTEGRATION_NAME,
            groupRef: process.env.AMPERSAND_GROUP_REF
          })}`
        }
      }
    });

    ```

    ```typescript
    // If you prefer to run the MCP server locally:
    
    import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

    // MCPClient with Ampersand MCP Server using stdio transport
    export const mcp = new MCPClient({
        servers: {
          "@amp-labs/mcp-server": {
            command: "npx",
            args: [
              "-y",
              "@amp-labs/mcp-server@latest",
              "--transport",
              "stdio",
              "--project",
              process.env.AMPERSAND_PROJECT_ID,
              "--integrationName",
              process.env.AMPERSAND_INTEGRATION_NAME,
              "--groupRef",
              process.env.AMPERSAND_GROUP_REF, // optional
            ],
            env: {
              AMPERSAND_API_KEY: process.env.AMPERSAND_API_KEY,
            },
          },
        },
    });
    ```

    As an alternative to MCP, Ampersand's AI SDK also has an adapter for Mastra, so you can [directly import Ampersand tools](https://docs.withampersand.com/ai-sdk#use-with-mastra) for your agent to access.

  </Tabs.Tab>

## Share your tools with an MCP server

If you have created your own Mastra tools, you can expose them to any MCP-compatible client using Mastra's `MCPServer` class.

Similarly, Mastra `Agent` and `Workflow` instances can also be exposed as tools via `MCPServer`. This allows other MCP clients to interact with your agents by "asking" them questions or run your workflows. Each agent provided in the `MCPServer` configuration will be converted into a tool named `ask_<agentKey>`, using the agent's `description` property. Each workflow will be converted into a tool named `run_<workflowKey>`, using its `inputSchema` and `description`.

This allows others to use your tools, agents, and workflows without needing direct access to your codebase.

### Using `MCPServer`

You initialize `MCPServer` with a name, version, and the Mastra tools, agents, and/or workflows you want to share.

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { weatherTool } from "./tools"; // Your Mastra tool
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents"; // Your Mastra Agent
import { dataWorkflow } from "./workflows"; // Your Mastra Workflow

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: "My Custom Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: { weatherTool }, // Provide your tool(s) here
  agents: { weatherAgent }, // Provide your agent(s) here
  workflows: { dataWorkflow }, // Provide your workflow(s) here
});

// Start the server (e.g., using stdio for a CLI tool)
// await server.startStdio();

// Or integrate with an HTTP server using startSSE()
// See MCPServer reference for details
```

For an agent to be exposed as a tool, it must have a non-empty `description` string. Similarly, for a workflow to be exposed, its `description` must also be a non-empty string. If the description is missing or empty for either, `MCPServer` will throw an error during initialization.
Workflows will use their `inputSchema` for the tool's input.

### Tools with Structured Outputs

You can define an `outputSchema` for your tools to enforce a specific structure for the tool's output. This is useful for ensuring that the tool returns data in a consistent and predictable format, which can then be validated by the client.

When a tool includes an `outputSchema`, its `execute` function **must** return an object. The value of the object must conform to the `outputSchema`. Mastra will automatically validate this output on both the server and client sides.

Here's an example of a tool with an `outputSchema`:

```typescript filename="src/tools/structured-tool.ts"
import { createTool } from '@mastra/core';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const structuredTool = createTool({
  description: 'A test tool that returns structured data.',
  parameters: z.object({
    input: z.string().describe('Some input string.'),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    processedInput: z.string().describe('The processed input string.'),
    timestamp: z.string().describe('An ISO timestamp.'),
  }),
  execute: async ({ input }) => {
    // When outputSchema is defined, you must return an object
    return {
      processedInput: `processed: ${input}`,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    };
  },
});
```

When this tool is called, the MCP client will receive both the structured data and a text representation of it.

```
Tool result

{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "{\"processedInput\": \"hello\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-06-19T16:53:16.472Z\"}"
    }
  ],
  "structuredContent": {
    "processedInput": "processed: hello",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-19T16:53:16.472Z",
  }
}
```

For detailed usage and examples, see the [`MCPServer` reference documentation](/reference/tools/mcp-server).

description: Understand what tools are in Mastra, how to add them to agents, and best practices for designing effective tools.

# Tools Overview
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/tools-mcp/overview

Tools are functions that agents can execute to perform specific tasks or access external information. They extend an agent's capabilities beyond simple text generation, allowing interaction with APIs, databases, or other systems.

Each tool typically defines:

- **Inputs:** What information the tool needs to run (defined with an `inputSchema`, often using Zod).
- **Outputs:** The structure of the data the tool returns (defined with an `outputSchema`).
- **Execution Logic:** The code that performs the tool's action.
- **Description:** Text that helps the agent understand what the tool does and when to use it.

## Creating Tools

In Mastra, you create tools using the [`createTool`](/reference/tools/create-tool) function from the `@mastra/core/tools` package.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/weatherInfo.ts" copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

const getWeatherInfo = async (city: string) => {
  // Replace with an actual API call to a weather service
  console.log(`Fetching weather for ${city}...`);
  // Example data structure
  return { temperature: 20, conditions: "Sunny" };
};

export const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "Get Weather Information",
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("City name"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    temperature: z.number(),
    conditions: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context: { city } }) => {
    console.log("Using tool to fetch weather information for", city);
    return await getWeatherInfo(city);
  },
});
```

This example defines a `weatherTool` with an input schema for the city, an output schema for the weather data, and an `execute` function that contains the tool's logic.

When creating tools, keep tool descriptions simple and focused on **what** the tool does and **when** to use it, emphasizing its primary use case. Technical details belong in the parameter schemas, guiding the agent on _how_ to use the tool correctly with descriptive names, clear descriptions, and explanations of default values.

## Adding Tools to an Agent

To make tools available to an agent, you configure them in the agent's definition. Mentioning available tools and their general purpose in the agent's system prompt can also improve tool usage. For detailed steps and examples, see the guide on [Using Tools and MCP with Agents](/docs/agents/using-tools-and-mcp#add-tools-to-an-agent).

## Compatibility Layer for Tool Schemas

Different models interpret schemas differely. Some error when certain schema properties are passed and some ignore certain schema properties but don't throw an error. Mastra adds a compatibility layer for tool schemas, ensuring tools work consistently across different model providers and that the schema constraints are respected.

Some providers that we include this layer for:

- **Google Gemini & Anthropic:** Remove unsupported schema properties and append relevant constraints to the tool description.
- **OpenAI (including reasoning models):** Strip or adapt schema fields that are ignored or unsupported, and add instructions to the description for agent guidance.
- **DeepSeek & Meta:** Apply similar compatibility logic to ensure schema alignment and tool usability.

This approach makes tool usage more reliable and model-agnostic for both custom and MCP tools.

title: "Branching, Merging, Conditions | Workflows | Mastra Docs"
description: "Control flow in Mastra workflows allows you to manage branching, merging, and conditions to construct workflows that meet your logic requirements."
---

# Control Flow
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/control-flow

When you build a workflow, you typically break down operations into smaller tasks that can be linked and reused. **Steps** provide a structured way to manage these tasks by defining inputs, outputs, and execution logic.

- If the schemas match, the `outputSchema` from each step is automatically passed to the `inputSchema` of the next step.
- If the schemas don't match, use [Input data mapping](./input-data-mapping.mdx) to transform the `outputSchema` into the expected `inputSchema`.

## Chaining steps with `.then()`

Chain steps to execute sequentially using `.then()`:

![Chaining steps with .then()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-then.jpg)

```typescript {8-9,4-5} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

This does what you'd expect: it executes `step1`, then it executes `step2`.

## Simultaneous steps with `.parallel()`

Execute steps simultaneously using `.parallel()`:

![Concurrent steps with .parallel()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-parallel.jpg)

```typescript {8,4-5} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});
const step3 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .parallel([step1, step2])
  .then(step3)
  .commit();
```

This executes `step1` and `step2` concurrently, then continues to `step3` after both complete.

> See [Parallel Execution with Steps](/examples/workflows/parallel-steps) for more information.

## Conditional logic with `.branch()`

Execute steps conditionally using `.branch()`:

![Conditional branching with .branch()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-branch.jpg)

```typescript {8-11,4-5} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const lessThanStep = createStep({...});
const greaterThanStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .branch([
    [async ({ inputData: { value } }) => (value < 9), lessThanStep],
    [async ({ inputData: { value } }) => (value >= 9), greaterThanStep]
  ])
  .commit();
```

Branch conditions are evaluated sequentially, but steps with matching conditions are executed in parallel.

> See [Workflow with Conditional Branching](/examples/workflows/conditional-branching) for more information.

## Looping steps

Workflows support two types of loops. When looping a step, or any step-compatible construct like a nested workflow, the initial `inputData` is sourced from the output of the previous step.

To ensure compatibility, the loop’s initial input must either match the shape of the previous step’s output, or be explicitly transformed using the `map` function.

- Match the shape of the previous step’s output, or
- Be explicitly transformed using the `map` function.

### Repeating with `.dowhile()`

Executes step repeatedly while a condition is true.

![Repeating with .dowhile()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-dowhile.jpg)

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const counterStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .dowhile(counterStep, async ({ inputData: { number } }) => number < 10)
  .commit();
```

### Repeating with `.dountil()`

Executes step repeatedly until a condition becomes true.

![Repeating with .dountil()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-dountil.jpg)

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const counterStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .dountil(counterStep, async ({ inputData: { number } }) => number > 10)
  .commit();
```

### Repeating with `.foreach()`

Sequentially executes the same step for each item from the `inputSchema`.

![Repeating with .foreach()](/image/workflows/workflows-control-flow-foreach.jpg)

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const mapStep = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .foreach(mapStep)
  .commit();
```

#### Setting concurrency limits

Use `concurrency` to execute steps in parallel with a limit on the number of concurrent executions.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const mapStep = createStep({...})

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .foreach(mapStep, { concurrency: 2 })
  .commit();
```

## Using a nested workflow

Use a nested workflow as a step by passing it to `.then()`. This runs each of its steps in sequence as part of the parent workflow.

```typescript {4,7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

export const nestedWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(nestedWorkflow)
  .commit();
```

## Cloning a workflow

Use `cloneWorkflow` to duplicate an existing workflow. This lets you reuse its structure while overriding parameters like `id`.

```typescript {6,10} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep, cloneWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const parentWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
const clonedWorkflow = cloneWorkflow(parentWorkflow, { id: "cloned-workflow" });

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .then(clonedWorkflow)
  .commit();
```

## Exiting early with `bail()`

Use `bail()` in a step to exit early with a successful result. This returns the provided payload as the step output and ends workflow execution.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({
  id: 'step1',
  execute: async ({ bail }) => {
    return bail({ result: 'bailed' });
  },
  inputSchema: z.object({ value: z.string() }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ result: z.string() }),
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

## Exiting early with `Error()`

Use `throw new Error()` in a step to exit with an error.

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({
  id: 'step1',
  execute: async () => {
    throw new Error('bailed');
  },
  inputSchema: z.object({ value: z.string() }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ result: z.string() }),
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

This throws an error from the step and stops workflow execution, returning the error as the result.

## Example Run Instance

The following example demonstrates how to start a run with multiple inputs. Each input will pass through the `mapStep` sequentially.

```typescript {6} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: [{ number: 10 }, { number: 100 }, { number: 200 }]
});
```

To execute this run from your terminal:

```bash copy
npx tsx src/test-workflow.ts
```

# Inngest Workflow
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/inngest-workflow

[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/docs) is a developer platform for building and running background workflows, without managing infrastructure.

## How Inngest Works with Mastra

Inngest and Mastra integrate by aligning their workflow models: Inngest organizes logic into functions composed of steps, and Mastra workflows defined using `createWorkflow` and `createStep` map directly onto this paradigm. Each Mastra workflow becomes an Inngest function with a unique identifier, and each step within the workflow maps to an Inngest step.

The `serve` function bridges the two systems by registering Mastra workflows as Inngest functions and setting up the necessary event handlers for execution and monitoring.

When an event triggers a workflow, Inngest executes it step by step, memoizing each step’s result. This means if a workflow is retried or resumed, completed steps are skipped, ensuring efficient and reliable execution. Control flow primitives in Mastra, such as loops, conditionals, and nested workflows are seamlessly translated into the same Inngest’s function/step model, preserving advanced workflow features like composition, branching, and suspension.

Real-time monitoring, suspend/resume, and step-level observability are enabled via Inngest’s publish-subscribe system and dashboard. As each step executes, its state and output are tracked using Mastra storage and can be resumed as needed.

## Setup

```sh
npm install @mastra/inngest @mastra/core @mastra/deployer
```

## Building an Inngest Workflow

This guide walks through creating a workflow with Inngest and Mastra, demonstrating a counter application that increments a value until it reaches 10.

### Inngest Initialization

Initialize the Inngest integration to obtain Mastra-compatible workflow helpers. The createWorkflow and createStep functions are used to create workflow and step objects that are compatible with Mastra and inngest.

In development

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/inngest/index.ts"
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { realtimeMiddleware } from "@inngest/realtime";

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "mastra",
  baseUrl:"http://localhost:3000",
  isDev: true,
  middleware: [realtimeMiddleware()],
});
```

In production

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/inngest/index.ts"
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { realtimeMiddleware } from "@inngest/realtime";

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "mastra",
  middleware: [realtimeMiddleware()],
});
```

### Creating Steps

Define the individual steps that will compose your workflow:

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/workflows/index.ts"
import { z } from "zod";
import { inngest } from "../inngest";
import { init } from "@mastra/inngest";

// Initialize Inngest with Mastra, pointing to your local Inngest server
const { createWorkflow, createStep } = init(inngest);

// Step: Increment the counter value
const incrementStep = createStep({
  id: "increment",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    return { value: inputData.value + 1 };
  },
});
```

### Creating the Workflow

Compose the steps into a workflow using the `dountil` loop pattern. The createWorkflow function creates a function on inngest server that is invocable.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/workflows/index.ts"
// workflow that is registered as a function on inngest server
const workflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "increment-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
}).then(incrementStep);

workflow.commit();

export { workflow as incrementWorkflow };
```

### Configuring the Mastra Instance and Executing the Workflow

Register the workflow with Mastra and configure the Inngest API endpoint:

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { serve as inngestServe } from "@mastra/inngest";
import { incrementWorkflow } from "./workflows";
import { inngest } from "./inngest";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";

// Configure Mastra with the workflow and Inngest API endpoint
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    incrementWorkflow,
  },
  server: {
    // The server configuration is required to allow local docker container can connect to the mastra server
    host: "0.0.0.0",
    apiRoutes: [
      // This API route is used to register the Mastra workflow (inngest function) on the inngest server
      {
        path: "/api/inngest",
        method: "ALL",
        createHandler: async ({ mastra }) => inngestServe({ mastra, inngest }),
        // The inngestServe function integrates Mastra workflows with Inngest by:
        // 1. Creating Inngest functions for each workflow with unique IDs (workflow.${workflowId})
        // 2. Setting up event handlers that:
        //    - Generate unique run IDs for each workflow execution
        //    - Create an InngestExecutionEngine to manage step execution
        //    - Handle workflow state persistence and real-time updates
        // 3. Establishing a publish-subscribe system for real-time monitoring
        //    through the workflow:${workflowId}:${runId} channel
      },
    ],
  },
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});
```

### Running the Workflow locally

> **Prerequisites:**
>
> - Docker installed and running
> - Mastra project set up
> - Dependencies installed (`npm install`)

1. Run `npx mastra dev` to start the Mastra server on local to serve the server on port 5000.
2. Start the Inngest Dev Server (via Docker)
   In a new terminal, run:

```sh
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  inngest/inngest \
  inngest dev -u http://host.docker.internal:5000/api/inngest
```

> **Note:** The URL after `-u` tells the Inngest dev server where to find your Mastra `/api/inngest` endpoint.

3. Open the Inngest Dashboard

- Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
- Go to the **Apps** section in the sidebar.

> - Vercel token (recommended: set as environment variable)

1. Add Vercel Deployer to Mastra instance

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { VercelDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-vercel";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...other config
  deployer: new VercelDeployer({
    teamSlug: "your_team_slug",
    projectName: "your_project_name",
    // you can get your vercel token from the vercel dashboard by clicking on the user icon in the top right corner
    // and then clicking on "Account Settings" and then clicking on "Tokens" on the left sidebar.
    token: "your_vercel_token",
  }),
});
```

> **Note:** Set your Vercel token in your environment:
>
> ```sh
> export VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
> ```

2. Build the mastra instance

```sh
npx mastra build
```

3. Deploy to Vercel

```sh
cd .mastra/output
vercel --prod
```

> **Tip:** If you haven't already, log in to Vercel CLI with `vercel login`.

4. Sync with Inngest Dashboard

- Go to the [Inngest dashboard](https://app.inngest.com/env/production/apps).

title: "Input Data Mapping with Workflow | Mastra Docs"
description: "Learn how to use workflow input mapping to create more dynamic data flows in your Mastra workflows."
---

# Input Data Mapping
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/input-data-mapping

Input data mapping allows explicit mapping of values for the inputs of the next step. These values can come from a number of sources:

- The outputs of a previous step
- The runtime context
- A constant value
- The initial input of the workflow

## Mapping with `.map()`

In this example the `output` from `step1` is transformed to match the `inputSchema` required for the `step2`. The value from `step1` is available using the `inputData` parameter of the `.map` function.

![Mapping with .map()](/image/workflows/workflows-data-mapping-map.jpg)

```typescript {9} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .map(async ({ inputData }) => {
    const { value } = inputData;
    return {
      output: `new ${value}`
    };
  })
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

## Using `inputData`

Use `inputData` to access the full output of the previous step:

```typescript {3} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
  .then(step1)
  .map(({ inputData }) => {
    console.log(inputData);
  })
```

## Using `getStepResult()`

Use `getStepResult` to access the full output of a specific step by referencing the step's instance:

```typescript {3} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
  .then(step1)
  .map(async ({ getStepResult }) => {
    console.log(getStepResult(step1));
  })
```

## Using `getInitData()`

Use `getInitData` to access the initial input data provided to the workflow:

```typescript {3} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
  .then(step1)
  .map(async ({ getInitData }) => {
      console.log(getInitData());
  })
```

## Using `mapVariable()`

To use `mapVariable` import the necessary function from the workflows module:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mapVariable } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
```

### Renaming step with `mapVariable()`

You can rename step outputs using the object syntax in `.map()`. In the example below, the `value` output from `step1` is renamed to `details`:

```typescript {3-6} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
  .then(step1)
  .map({
    details: mapVariable({
      step: step,
      path: "value"
    })
  })
```

### Renaming workflows with `mapVariable()`

You can rename workflow outputs by using **referential composition**. This involves passing the workflow instance as the `initData`.

```typescript {6-9} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...});

testWorkflow
  .then(step1)
  .map({
    details: mapVariable({
      initData: testWorkflow,
      path: "value"
    })
  })
```

title: "Handling Complex LLM Operations | Workflows | Mastra"
description: "Workflows in Mastra help you orchestrate complex sequences of operations with features like branching, parallel execution, resource suspension, and more."
---

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

# Workflows overview
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/overview

Workflows let you define and orchestrate complex sequences of tasks as **typed steps** connected by data flows. Each step has clearly defined inputs and outputs validated by Zod schemas.

A workflow manages execution order, dependencies, branching, parallelism, and error handling — enabling you to build robust, reusable processes. Steps can be nested or cloned to compose larger workflows.

![Workflows overview](/image/workflows/workflows-overview.jpg)

You create workflows by:

- Defining **steps** with `createStep`, specifying input/output schemas and business logic.
- Composing **steps** with `createWorkflow` to define the execution flow.
- Running **workflows** to execute the entire sequence, with built-in support for suspension, resumption, and streaming results.

This structure provides full type safety and runtime validation, ensuring data integrity across the entire workflow.


## Getting started

To use workflows, first import the necessary functions from the workflows module:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";
```

### Create step

Steps are the building blocks of workflows. Create a step using `createStep`:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const step1 = createStep({...});
```

> See [createStep](/reference/workflows/step) for more information.

### Create workflow

Create a workflow using `createWorkflow` and complete it with `.commit()`.

```typescript {6,17} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  description: 'Test workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

> See [workflow](/reference/workflows/workflow) for more information.

#### Composing steps

Workflow steps can be composed and executed sequentially using `.then()`.

```typescript {17,18} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  description: 'Test workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

> Steps can be composed using a number of different methods. See [Control Flow](/docs/workflows/control-flow)  for more information.

#### Cloning steps

Workflow steps can be cloned using `cloneStep()`, and used with any workflow method.

```typescript {5,19} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep, cloneStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const clonedStep = cloneStep(step1, { id: "cloned-step" });
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  description: 'Test workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .then(clonedStep)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

### Register workflow

Register a workflow using `workflows` in the main Mastra instance:

```typescript {8} filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";

import { testWorkflow } from "./workflows/test-workflow";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: { testWorkflow },
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    // stores telemetry, evals, ... into memory storage, if it needs to persist, change to file:../mastra.db
    url: ":memory:"
  }),
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info"
  })
});
```

### Run workflow
There are two ways to run and test workflows.

<Steps>

#### Mastra Playground

With the Mastra Dev Server running you can run the workflow from the Mastra Playground by visiting [http://localhost:5000/workflows](http://localhost:5000/workflows) in your browser.

#### Command line

Create a run instance of any Mastra workflow using `createRunAsync` and `start`:

```typescript {3,5} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    city: "London"
  }
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
```
> see [createRunAsync](/reference/workflows/create-run) and [start](/reference/workflows/start) for more information.

To trigger this workflow, run the following:

```bash copy
npx tsx src/test-workflow.ts
```

</Steps>

#### Run workflow results

The result of running a workflow using either `start()` or `resume()` will look like one of the following, depending on the outcome.

##### Status success

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "steps": {
    // ...
    "step-1": {
      // ...
      "status": "success",
    }
  },
  "result": {
    "output": "London + step-1"
  }
}
```

- **status**: Shows the final state of the workflow execution, either: `success`, `suspended`, or `error`
- **steps**: Lists each step in the workflow, including inputs and outputs
- **status**: Shows the outcome of each individual step
- **result**: Includes the final output of the workflow, typed according to the `outputSchema`


##### Status suspended

```json
{
  "status": "suspended",
  "steps": {
    // ...
    "step-1": {
      // ...
      "status": "suspended",
    }
  },
  "suspended": [
    [
      "step-1"
    ]
  ]
}
```

- **suspended**: An optional array listing any steps currently awaiting input before continuing

##### Status failed

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "steps": {
    // ...
    "step-1": {
      // ...
      "status": "failed",
      "error": "Test error",
    }
  },
  "error": "Test error"
}
```
- **error**: An optional field that includes the error message if the workflow fails

### Stream workflow

Similar to the run method shown above, workflows can also be streamed:

```typescript {5} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

const result = await run.stream({
  inputData: {
    city: "London"
  }
});

for await (const chunk of result.stream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

> See [stream](/reference/workflows/stream) and [messages](/reference/workflows/stream#messages) for more information.

### Watch Workflow

A workflow can also be watched, allowing you to inspect each event that is emitted.

```typescript {5} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

run.watch((event) => {
  console.log(event);
});

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    city: "London"
  }
});
```

> See [watch](/reference/workflows/watch) for more information.

title: "Pausing Execution | Mastra Docs"
description: "Pausing execution in Mastra workflows allows you to pause execution while waiting for external input or resources via .sleep(), .sleepUntil() and .waitForEvent()."
---

# Sleep & Events
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/pausing-execution

Mastra lets you pause workflow execution when waiting for external input or timing conditions. This can be useful for things like polling, delayed retries, or waiting on user actions.

You can pause execution using:

- `sleep()`: Pause for a set number of milliseconds
- `sleepUntil()`: Pause until a specific timestamp
- `waitForEvent()`: Pause until an external event is received
- `sendEvent()`: Send an event to resume a waiting workflow

When using any of these methods, the workflow status is set to `waiting` until execution resumes.

## Pausing with `.sleep()`

The `sleep()` method pauses execution between steps for a specified number of milliseconds.

```typescript {9} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .sleep(1000)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

### Pausing with `.sleep(callback)`

The `sleep()` method also accepts a callback that returns the number of milliseconds to pause. The callback receives `inputData`, allowing the delay to be computed dynamically.

```typescript {9} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .sleep(async ({ inputData }) => {
    const { delayInMs }  = inputData
    return delayInMs;
  })
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

## Pausing with `.sleepUntil()`

The `sleepUntil()` method pauses execution between steps until a specified date.

```typescript {9} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .sleepUntil(new Date(Date.now() + 5000))
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

### Pausing with `.sleepUntil(callback)`

The `sleepUntil()` method also accepts a callback that returns a `Date` object. The callback receives `inputData`, allowing the target time to be computed dynamically.

```typescript {9} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .sleepUntil(async ({ inputData }) => {
    const { delayInMs }  = inputData
    return new Date(Date.now() + delayInMs);
  })
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```


> `Date.now()` is evaluated when the workflow starts, not at the moment the `sleepUntil()` method is called.

## Pausing with `.waitForEvent()`

The `waitForEvent()` method pauses execution until a specific event is received. Use `run.sendEvent()` to send the event. You must provide both the event name and the step to resume.

![Pausing with .waitForEvent()](/image/workflows/workflows-sleep-events-waitforevent.jpg)

```typescript {10} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});
const step3 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .waitForEvent("my-event-name", step2)
  .then(step3)
  .commit();
```
## Sending an event with `.sendEvent()`

The `.sendEvent()` method sends an event to the workflow. It accepts the event name and optional event data, which can be any JSON-serializable value.

```typescript {5,12,15} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

const result = run.start({
  inputData: {
    value: "hello"
  }
});

setTimeout(() => {
  run.sendEvent("my-event-name", { value: "from event" });
}, 3000);

console.log(JSON.stringify(await result, null, 2));
```

> In this example, avoid using `await run.start()` directly, it would block sending the event before the workflow reaches its waiting state.

title: "Suspend & Resume Workflows | Human-in-the-Loop | Mastra Docs"
description: "Suspend and resume in Mastra workflows allows you to pause execution while waiting for external input or resources."
---

# Suspend & Resume
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/suspend-and-resume

Workflows can be paused at any step, with their current state persisted as a snapshot in storage. Execution can then be resumed from this saved snapshot when ready. Persisting the snapshot ensures the workflow state is maintained across sessions, deployments, and server restarts, essential for workflows that may remain suspended while awaiting external input or resources.

Common scenarios for suspending workflows include:

- Waiting for human approval or input
- Pausing until external API resources become available
- Collecting additional data needed for later steps
- Rate limiting or throttling expensive operations
- Handling event-driven processes with external triggers

## Workflow status types

When running a workflow, its `status` can be one of the following:

- `running` - The workflow is currently running
- `suspended` - The workflow is suspended
- `success` - The workflow has completed
- `failed` - The workflow has failed

## Suspending a workflow with `suspend()`

When the state is `suspended`, you can identify any and all steps that have been suspended by looking at the `suspended` array of the workflow result output.

![Suspending a workflow with suspend()](/image/workflows/workflows-suspend-resume-suspend.jpg)

```typescript {18} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const step1 = createStep({
  id: "step-1",
  description: "Test suspend",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  }),
  suspendSchema: z.object({}),
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string()
  }),
  execute: async ({ resumeData, suspend }) => {
    const { city } = resumeData ?? {};

    if (!city) {
      await suspend({});
      return { output: "" };
    }

    return { output: "" };
  }
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

> See [Define Suspendable workflow](/examples/workflows/human-in-the-loop#define-suspendable-workflow) for more information.

### Identifying suspended steps

To resume a suspended workflow, inspect the `suspended` array in the result to determine which step needs input:

```typescript {15} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    city: "London"
  }
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    step: result.suspended[0],
    resumeData: {
      city: "Berlin"
    }
  });
}

```

In this case, the logic resumes the first step listed in the `suspended` array. A `step` can also be defined using it's `id`, for example: 'step-1'.

```json
{
  "status": "suspended",
  "steps": {
    // ...
    "step-1": {
      // ...
      "status": "suspended",
    }
  },
  "suspended": [
    [
      "step-1"
    ]
  ]
}
```

> See [Run Workflow Results](/workflows/overview#run-workflow-results) for more details.

## Resuming a workflow with `resume()`

A workflow can be resumed by calling `resume` and providing the required `resumeData`.

```typescript {16-18} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
   inputData: {
    city: "London"
  }
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    step: 'step-1',
    resumeData: {
      city: "Berlin"
    }
  });

  console.log(JSON.stringify(resumedResult, null, 2));
}
```

### Resuming nested workflows

To resume a suspended nested workflow pass the workflow instance to the `step` parameter of the `resume` function.

```typescript {33-34} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const dowhileWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: 'dowhile-workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({ value: z.number() }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ value: z.number() }),
})
  .dountil(
    createWorkflow({
      id: 'simple-resume-workflow',
      inputSchema: z.object({ value: z.number() }),
      outputSchema: z.object({ value: z.number() }),
      steps: [incrementStep, resumeStep],
    })
      .then(incrementStep)
      .then(resumeStep)
      .commit(),
    async ({ inputData }) => inputData.value >= 10,
  )
  .then(
    createStep({
      id: 'final',
      inputSchema: z.object({ value: z.number() }),
      outputSchema: z.object({ value: z.number() }),
      execute: async ({ inputData }) => ({ value: inputData.value }),
    }),
  )
  .commit();

const run = await dowhileWorkflow.createRunAsync();
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { value: 0 } });

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    resumeData: { value: 2 },
    step: ['simple-resume-workflow', 'resume'],
  });

  console.log(JSON.stringify(resumedResult, null, 2));
}
```

## Using `RuntimeContext` with suspend/resume

When using suspend/resume with `RuntimeContext`, you can create the instance yourself, and pass it to the `start` and `resume` functions.
`RuntimeContext` is not automatically shared on a workflow run.

```typescript {1,4,9,16} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.tss" showLineNumbers copy
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/di";
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: { suggestions: ["London", "Paris", "New York"] },
  runtimeContext
});

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    step: 'step-1',
    resumeData: { city: "New York" },
    runtimeContext
  });
}
```

# Agents and Tools
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows/using-with-agents-and-tools

Workflow steps are composable and typically run logic directly within the `execute` function. However, there are cases where calling an agent or tool is more appropriate. This pattern is especially useful when:

- Generating natural language responses from user input using an LLM.
- Abstracting complex or reusable logic into a dedicated tool.
- Interacting with third-party APIs in a structured or reusable way.

Workflows can use Mastra agents or tools directly as steps, for example: `createStep(testAgent)` or `createStep(testTool)`.

## Using agents in workflows

To include an agent in a workflow, define it in the usual way, then either add it directly to the workflow using `createStep(testAgent)` or, invoke it from within a step's `execute` function using `.generate()`.

### Example agent

This agent uses OpenAI to generate a fact about a city, country, and timezone.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/test-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

export const testAgent = new Agent({
  name: "test-agent",
  description: "Create facts for a country based on the city",
  instructions: `Return an interesting fact about the country based on the city provided`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o")
});
```

### Adding an agent as a step

In this example, `step1` uses the `testAgent` to generate an interesting fact about the country based on a given city.

The `.map` method transforms the workflow input into a `prompt` string compatible with the `testAgent`.

The step is composed into the workflow using `.then()`, allowing it to receive the mapped input and return the agent's structured output. The workflow is finalized with `.commit()`.


![Agent as step](/image/workflows/workflows-agent-tools-agent-step.jpg)


```typescript {3} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { testAgent } from "../agents/test-agent";

const step1 = createStep(testAgent);

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  description: 'Test workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .map(({ inputData }) => {
    const { input } = inputData;
    return {
      prompt: `Provide facts about the city: ${input}`
    };
  })
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

### Calling an agent with `.generate()`

In this example, the `step1` builds a prompt using the provided `input` and passes it to the `testAgent`, which returns a plain-text response containing facts about the city and its country.

The step is added to the workflow using the sequential `.then()` method, allowing it to receive input from the workflow and return structured output. The workflow is finalized with `.commit()`.

```typescript {1,18, 29} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { testAgent } from "../agents/test-agent";

const step1 = createStep({
  id: "step-1",
  description: "Create facts for a country based on the city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  }),

  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const { input } = inputData;

    const  prompt = `Provide facts about the city: ${input}`

    const { text } = await testAgent.generate([
      { role: "user", content: prompt }
    ]);

    return {
      output: text
    };
  }
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

## Using tools in workflows

To use a tool within a workflow, define it in the usual way, then either add it directly to the workflow using `createStep(testTool)` or, invoke it from within a step's `execute` function using `.execute()`.

### Example tool

The example below uses the Open Meteo API to retrieve geolocation details for a city, returning its name, country, and timezone.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/test-tool.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core";
import { z } from "zod";

export const testTool = createTool({
  id: "test-tool",
  description: "Gets country for a city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    country_name: z.string()
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const { input } = context;
    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(`https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${input}`);
    const geocodingData = await geocodingResponse.json();

    const { country } = geocodingData.results[0];

    return {
      country_name: country
    };
  }
});
```

### Adding a tool as a step

In this example, `step1` uses the `testTool`, which performs a geocoding lookup using the provided `city` and returns the resolved `country`.

The step is added to the workflow using the sequential `.then()` method, allowing it to receive input from the workflow and return structured output. The workflow is finalized with `.commit()`.

![Tool as step](/image/workflows/workflows-agent-tools-tool-step.jpg)

```typescript {1,3,6} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { testTool } from "../tools/test-tool";

const step1 = createStep(testTool);

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

### Calling a tool with `.execute()`

In this example, `step1` directly invokes `testTool` using its `.execute()` method. The tool performs a geocoding lookup with the provided `city` and returns the corresponding `country`.

The result is returned as structured output from the step. The step is composed into the workflow using `.then()`, enabling it to process workflow input and produce typed output. The workflow is finalized with `.commit()`

```typescript {3,20,32} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/di";

import { testTool } from "../tools/test-tool";

const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();

const step1 = createStep({
  id: "step-1",
  description: "Gets country for a city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    input: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  }),

  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const { input } = inputData;

    const { country_name } = await testTool.execute({
      context: { input },
      runtimeContext
    });

    return {
      output: country_name
    };
  }
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

## Using workflows as tools

In this example the `cityStringWorkflow` workflow has been added to the main Mastra instance.


```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

import { testWorkflow, cityStringWorkflow } from "./workflows/test-workflow";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  ...
  workflows: { testWorkflow, cityStringWorkflow },
});
```

Once a workflow has been registered it can be referenced using `getWorkflow` from withing a tool.

```typescript {10,17-27} filename="src/mastra/tools/test-tool.ts" showLineNumbers copy
export const cityCoordinatesTool = createTool({
  id: "city-tool",
  description: "Convert city details",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    outcome: z.string()
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    const { city } = context;
    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(`https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${city}`);
    const geocodingData = await geocodingResponse.json();

    const { name, country, timezone } = geocodingData.results[0];

    const workflow = mastra?.getWorkflow("cityStringWorkflow");

    const run = await workflow?.createRunAsync();

    const { result } = await run?.start({
      inputData: {
        city_name: name,
        country_name: country,
        country_timezone: timezone
      }
    });

    return {
      outcome: result.outcome
    };
  }
});
```

## Exposing workflows with `MCPServer`

You can convert your workflows into tools by passing them into an instance of a Mastra `MCPServer`. This allows any MCP-compatible client to access your workflow.

The workflow description becomes the tool description and the input schema becomes the tool's input schema.

When you provide workflows to the server, each workflow is automatically exposed as a callable tool for example:

- `run_testWorkflow`.

```typescript filename="src/test-mcp-server.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";

import { testAgent } from "./mastra/agents/test-agent";
import { testTool } from "./mastra/tools/test-tool";
import { testWorkflow } from "./mastra/workflows/test-workflow";

async function startServer() {
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "test-mcp-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    workflows: {
      testWorkflow
    }
  });

  await server.startStdio();
  console.log("MCPServer started on stdio");
}

startServer().catch(console.error);
```

To verify that your workflow is available on the server, you can connect with an MCPClient.

```typescript filename="src/test-mcp-client.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

async function main() {
  const mcp = new MCPClient({
    servers: {
      local: {
        command: "npx",
        args: ["tsx", "src/test-mcp-server.ts"]
      }
    }
  });

  const tools = await mcp.getTools();
  console.log(tools);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

Run the client script to see your workflow tool.

```bash
npx tsx src/test-mcp-client.ts
```

# Control Flow in Legacy Workflows: Branching, Merging, and Conditions
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows-legacy/control-flow

When you create a multi-step process, you may need to run steps in parallel, chain them sequentially, or follow different paths based on outcomes. This page describes how you can manage branching, merging, and conditions to construct workflows that meet your logic requirements. The code snippets show the key patterns for structuring complex control flow.

## Parallel Execution

You can run multiple steps at the same time if they don't depend on each other. This approach can speed up your workflow when steps perform independent tasks. The code below shows how to add two steps in parallel:

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(fetchUserData).step(fetchOrderData);
```

See the [Parallel Steps](../../examples/workflows_legacy/parallel-steps.mdx) example for more details.

## Sequential Execution

Sometimes you need to run steps in strict order to ensure outputs from one step become inputs for the next. Use .then() to link dependent operations. The code below shows how to chain steps sequentially:

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(fetchOrderData).then(validateData).then(processOrder);
```

See the [Sequential Steps](../../examples/workflows_legacy/sequential-steps.mdx) example for more details.

## Branching and Merging Paths

When different outcomes require different paths, branching is helpful. You can also merge paths later once they complete. The code below shows how to branch after stepA and later converge on stepF:

```typescript
myWorkflow
  .step(stepA)
  .then(stepB)
  .then(stepD)
  .after(stepA)
  .step(stepC)
  .then(stepE)
  .after([stepD, stepE])
  .step(stepF);
```

In this example:

- stepA leads to stepB, then to stepD.
- Separately, stepA also triggers stepC, which in turn leads to stepE.
- Separately, stepF is triggered when both stepD and stepE are completed.

See the [Branching Paths](../../examples/workflows_legacy/branching-paths.mdx) example for more details.

## Merging Multiple Branches

Sometimes you need a step to execute only after multiple other steps have completed. Mastra provides a compound `.after([])` syntax that allows you to specify multiple dependencies for a step.

```typescript
myWorkflow
  .step(fetchUserData)
  .then(validateUserData)
  .step(fetchProductData)
  .then(validateProductData)
  // This step will only run after BOTH validateUserData AND validateProductData have completed
  .after([validateUserData, validateProductData])
  .step(processOrder);
```

In this example:

- `fetchUserData` and `fetchProductData` run in parallel branches
- Each branch has its own validation step
- The `processOrder` step only executes after both validation steps have completed successfully

This pattern is particularly useful for:

- Joining parallel execution paths
- Implementing synchronization points in your workflow
- Ensuring all required data is available before proceeding

You can also create complex dependency patterns by combining multiple `.after([])` calls:

```typescript
myWorkflow
  // First branch
  .step(stepA)
  .then(stepB)
  .then(stepC)

  // Second branch
  .step(stepD)
  .then(stepE)

  // Third branch
  .step(stepF)
  .then(stepG)

  // This step depends on the completion of multiple branches
  .after([stepC, stepE, stepG])
  .step(finalStep);
```

## Cyclical Dependencies and Loops

Workflows often need to repeat steps until certain conditions are met. Mastra provides two powerful methods for creating loops: `until` and `while`. These methods offer an intuitive way to implement repetitive tasks.

### Using Manual Cyclical Dependencies (Legacy Approach)

In earlier versions, you could create loops by manually defining cyclical dependencies with conditions:

```typescript
myWorkflow
  .step(fetchData)
  .then(processData)
  .after(processData)
  .step(finalizeData, {
    when: { "processData.status": "success" },
  })
  .step(fetchData, {
    when: { "processData.status": "retry" },
  });
```

While this approach still works, the newer `until` and `while` methods provide a cleaner and more maintainable way to create loops.

### Using `until` for Condition-Based Loops

The `until` method repeats a step until a specified condition becomes true. It takes these arguments:

1. A condition that determines when to stop looping
2. The step to repeat
3. Optional variables to pass to the repeated step

```typescript
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Step that increments a counter until target is reached
const incrementStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "increment",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    // Current counter value
    counter: z.number().optional(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    // Updated counter value
    updatedCounter: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const { counter = 0 } = context.inputData;
    return { updatedCounter: counter + 1 };
  },
});

workflow
  .step(incrementStep)
  .until(
    async ({ context }) => {
      // Stop when counter reaches 10
      const result = context.getStepResult(incrementStep);
      return (result?.updatedCounter ?? 0) >= 10;
    },
    incrementStep,
    {
      // Pass current counter to next iteration
      counter: {
        step: incrementStep,
        path: "updatedCounter",
      },
    },
  )
  .then(finalStep);
```

You can also use a reference-based condition:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(incrementStep)
  .until(
    {
      ref: { step: incrementStep, path: "updatedCounter" },
      query: { $gte: 10 },
    },
    incrementStep,
    {
      counter: {
        step: incrementStep,
        path: "updatedCounter",
      },
    },
  )
  .then(finalStep);
```

### Using `while` for Condition-Based Loops

The `while` method repeats a step as long as a specified condition remains true. It takes the same arguments as `until`:

1. A condition that determines when to continue looping
2. The step to repeat
3. Optional variables to pass to the repeated step

```typescript
// Step that increments a counter while below target
const incrementStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "increment",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    // Current counter value
    counter: z.number().optional(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    // Updated counter value
    updatedCounter: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const { counter = 0 } = context.inputData;
    return { updatedCounter: counter + 1 };
  },
});

workflow
  .step(incrementStep)
  .while(
    async ({ context }) => {
      // Continue while counter is less than 10
      const result = context.getStepResult(incrementStep);
      return (result?.updatedCounter ?? 0) < 10;
    },
    incrementStep,
    {
      // Pass current counter to next iteration
      counter: {
        step: incrementStep,
        path: "updatedCounter",
      },
    },
  )
  .then(finalStep);
```

You can also use a reference-based condition:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(incrementStep)
  .while(
    {
      ref: { step: incrementStep, path: "updatedCounter" },
      query: { $lt: 10 },
    },
    incrementStep,
    {
      counter: {
        step: incrementStep,
        path: "updatedCounter",
      },
    },
  )
  .then(finalStep);
```

### Comparison Operators for Reference Conditions

When using reference-based conditions, you can use these comparison operators:

| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `$eq`    | Equal to                 |
| `$ne`    | Not equal to             |
| `$gt`    | Greater than             |
| `$gte`   | Greater than or equal to |
| `$lt`    | Less than                |
| `$lte`   | Less than or equal to    |

## Conditions

Use the when property to control whether a step runs based on data from previous steps. Below are three ways to specify conditions.

### Option 1: Function

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(
  new Step({
    id: "processData",
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      // Action logic
    },
  }),
  {
    when: async ({ context }) => {
      const fetchData = context?.getStepResult<{ status: string }>("fetchData");
      return fetchData?.status === "success";
    },
  },
);
```

### Option 2: Query Object

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(
  new Step({
    id: "processData",
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      // Action logic
    },
  }),
  {
    when: {
      ref: {
        step: {
          id: "fetchData",
        },
        path: "status",
      },
      query: { $eq: "success" },
    },
  },
);
```

### Option 3: Simple Path Comparison

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(
  new Step({
    id: "processData",
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      // Action logic
    },
  }),
  {
    when: {
      "fetchData.status": "success",
    },
  },
);
```

## Data Access Patterns

Mastra provides several ways to pass data between steps:

1. **Context Object** - Access step results directly through the context object
2. **Variable Mapping** - Explicitly map outputs from one step to inputs of another
3. **getStepResult Method** - Type-safe method to retrieve step outputs

Each approach has its advantages depending on your use case and requirements for type safety.

### Using getStepResult Method

The `getStepResult` method provides a type-safe way to access step results. This is the recommended approach when working with TypeScript as it preserves type information.

#### Basic Usage

For better type safety, you can provide a type parameter to `getStepResult`:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/get-step-result.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const fetchUserStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "fetchUser",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    userId: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    return { name: "John Doe", userId: "123" };
  },
});

const analyzeDataStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "analyzeData",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Type-safe access to previous step result
    const userData = context.getStepResult<{ name: string; userId: string }>(
      "fetchUser",
    );

    if (!userData) {
      return { status: "error", message: "User data not found" };
    }

    return {
      analysis: `Analyzed data for user ${userData.name}`,
      userId: userData.userId,
    };
  },
});
```

#### Using Step References

The most type-safe approach is to reference the step directly in the `getStepResult` call:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/step-reference.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define step with output schema
const fetchUserStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "fetchUser",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async () => {
    return {
      userId: "user123",
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "john@example.com",
    };
  },
});

const processUserStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processUser",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // TypeScript will infer the correct type from fetchUserStep's outputSchema
    const userData = context.getStepResult(fetchUserStep);

    return {
      processed: true,
      userName: userData?.name,
    };
  },
});

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "user-workflow",
});

workflow.step(fetchUserStep).then(processUserStep).commit();
```

### Using Variable Mapping

Variable mapping is an explicit way to define data flow between steps.
This approach makes dependencies clear and provides good type safety.
The data injected into the step is available in the `context.inputData` object, and typed based on the `inputSchema` of the step.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/variable-mapping.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const fetchUserStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "fetchUser",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async () => {
    return {
      userId: "user123",
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "john@example.com",
    };
  },
});

const sendEmailStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "sendEmail",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    recipientEmail: z.string(),
    recipientName: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const { recipientEmail, recipientName } = context.inputData;

    // Send email logic here
    return {
      status: "sent",
      to: recipientEmail,
    };
  },
});

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "email-workflow",
});

workflow
  .step(fetchUserStep)
  .then(sendEmailStep, {
    variables: {
      // Map specific fields from fetchUser to sendEmail inputs
      recipientEmail: { step: fetchUserStep, path: "email" },
      recipientName: { step: fetchUserStep, path: "name" },
    },
  })
  .commit();
```

For more details on variable mapping, see the [Data Mapping with Workflow Variables](./variables.mdx) documentation.

### Using the Context Object

The context object provides direct access to all step results and their outputs. This approach is more flexible but requires careful handling to maintain type safety.
You can access step results directly through the `context.steps` object:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/context-access.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const processOrderStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processOrder",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Access data from a previous step
    let userData: { name: string; userId: string };
    if (context.steps["fetchUser"]?.status === "success") {
      userData = context.steps.fetchUser.output;
    } else {
      throw new Error("User data not found");
    }

    return {
      orderId: "order123",
      userId: userData.userId,
      status: "processing",
    };
  },
});

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "order-workflow",
});

workflow.step(fetchUserStep).then(processOrderStep).commit();
```

### Workflow-Level Type Safety

For comprehensive type safety across your entire workflow, you can define types for all steps and pass them to the Workflow
This allows you to get type safety for the context object on conditions, and on step results in the final workflow output.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/workflow-typing.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Create steps with typed outputs
const fetchUserStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "fetchUser",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async () => {
    return {
      userId: "user123",
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "john@example.com",
    };
  },
});

const processOrderStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processOrder",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // TypeScript knows the shape of userData
    const userData = context.getStepResult(fetchUserStep);

    return {
      orderId: "order123",
      status: "processing",
    };
  },
});

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow<
  [typeof fetchUserStep, typeof processOrderStep]
>({
  name: "typed-workflow",
});

workflow
  .step(fetchUserStep)
  .then(processOrderStep)
  .until(async ({ context }) => {
    // TypeScript knows the shape of userData here
    const res = context.getStepResult("fetchUser");
    return res?.userId === "123";
  }, processOrderStep)
  .commit();
```

### Accessing Trigger Data

In addition to step results, you can access the original trigger data that started the workflow:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/trigger-data.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define trigger schema
const triggerSchema = z.object({
  customerId: z.string(),
  orderItems: z.array(z.string()),
});

type TriggerType = z.infer<typeof triggerSchema>;

const processOrderStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processOrder",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Access trigger data with type safety
    const triggerData = context.getStepResult<TriggerType>("trigger");

    return {
      customerId: triggerData?.customerId,
      itemCount: triggerData?.orderItems.length || 0,
      status: "processing",
    };
  },
});

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "order-workflow",
  triggerSchema,
});

workflow.step(processOrderStep).commit();
```

### Accessing Resume Data

The data injected into the step is available in the `context.inputData` object, and typed based on the `inputSchema` of the step.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/resume-data.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const processOrderStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processOrder",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    orderId: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    const { orderId } = context.inputData;

    if (!orderId) {
      await suspend();
      return;
    }

    return {
      orderId,
      status: "processed",
    };
  },
});

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "order-workflow",
});

workflow.step(processOrderStep).commit();

const run = workflow.createRun();
const result = await run.start();

const resumedResult = await workflow.resume({
  runId: result.runId,
  stepId: "processOrder",
  inputData: {
    orderId: "123",
  },
});

console.log({ resumedResult });
```

### Accessing Workflow Results

You can get typed access to the results of a workflow by injecting the step types into the `Workflow` type params:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/get-results.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const fetchUserStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "fetchUser",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async () => {
    return {
      userId: "user123",
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "john@example.com",
    };
  },
});

const processOrderStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processOrder",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    orderId: z.string(),
    status: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const userData = context.getStepResult(fetchUserStep);
    return {
      orderId: "order123",
      status: "processing",
    };
  },
});

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow<
  [typeof fetchUserStep, typeof processOrderStep]
>({
  name: "typed-workflow",
});

workflow.step(fetchUserStep).then(processOrderStep).commit();

const run = workflow.createRun();
const result = await run.start();

// The result is a discriminated union of the step results
// So it needs to be narrowed down via status checks
if (result.results.processOrder.status === "success") {
  // TypeScript will know the shape of the results
  const orderId = result.results.processOrder.output.orderId;
  console.log({ orderId });
}

if (result.results.fetchUser.status === "success") {
  const userId = result.results.fetchUser.output.userId;
  console.log({ userId });
}
```

### Best Practices for Data Flow

1. **Use getStepResult with Step References for Type Safety**

   - Ensures TypeScript can infer the correct types
   - Catches type errors at compile time

2. \*_Use Variable Mapping for Explicit Dependencies_

   - Makes data flow clear and maintainable
   - Provides good documentation of step dependencies

3. **Define Output Schemas for Steps**

   - Validates data at runtime
   - Validates return type of the `execute` function
   - Improves type inference in TypeScript

4. **Handle Missing Data Gracefully**

   - Always check if step results exist before accessing properties
   - Provide fallback values for optional data

5. **Keep Data Transformations Simple**
   - Transform data in dedicated steps rather than in variable mappings
   - Makes workflows easier to test and debug

### Comparison of Data Flow Methods

| Method           | Type Safety | Explicitness | Use Case                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| getStepResult    | Highest     | High         | Complex workflows with strict typing requirements |
| Variable Mapping | High        | High         | When dependencies need to be clear and explicit   |
| context.steps    | Medium      | Low          | Quick access to step data in simple workflows     |

By choosing the right data flow method for your use case, you can create workflows that are both type-safe and maintainable.

# Dynamic Workflows (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows-legacy/dynamic-workflows

This guide demonstrates how to create dynamic workflows within a workflow step. This advanced pattern allows you to create and execute workflows on the fly based on runtime conditions.

## Overview

Dynamic workflows are useful when you need to create workflows based on runtime data.

## Implementation

The key to creating dynamic workflows is accessing the Mastra instance from within a step's `execute` function and using it to create and run a new workflow.

### Basic Example

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const isMastra = (mastra: any): mastra is Mastra => {
  return mastra && typeof mastra === "object" && mastra instanceof Mastra;
};

// Step that creates and runs a dynamic workflow
const createDynamicWorkflow = new LegacyStep({
  id: "createDynamicWorkflow",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    dynamicWorkflowResult: z.any(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    if (!mastra) {
      throw new Error("Mastra instance not available");
    }

    if (!isMastra(mastra)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid Mastra instance");
    }

    const inputData = context.triggerData.inputData;

    // Create a new dynamic workflow
    const dynamicWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
      name: "dynamic-workflow",
      mastra, // Pass the mastra instance to the new workflow
      triggerSchema: z.object({
        dynamicInput: z.string(),
      }),
    });

    // Define steps for the dynamic workflow
    const dynamicStep = new LegacyStep({
      id: "dynamicStep",
      execute: async ({ context }) => {
        const dynamicInput = context.triggerData.dynamicInput;
        return {
          processedValue: `Processed: ${dynamicInput}`,
        };
      },
    });

    // Build and commit the dynamic workflow
    dynamicWorkflow.step(dynamicStep).commit();

    // Create a run and execute the dynamic workflow
    const run = dynamicWorkflow.createRun();
    const result = await run.start({
      triggerData: {
        dynamicInput: inputData,
      },
    });

    let dynamicWorkflowResult;

    if (result.results["dynamicStep"]?.status === "success") {
      dynamicWorkflowResult =
        result.results["dynamicStep"]?.output.processedValue;
    } else {
      throw new Error("Dynamic workflow failed");
    }

    // Return the result from the dynamic workflow
    return {
      dynamicWorkflowResult,
    };
  },
});

// Main workflow that uses the dynamic workflow creator
const mainWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "main-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputData: z.string(),
  }),
  mastra: new Mastra(),
});

mainWorkflow.step(createDynamicWorkflow).commit();

// Register the workflow with Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { mainWorkflow },
});

const run = mainWorkflow.createRun();
const result = await run.start({
  triggerData: {
    inputData: "test",
  },
});
```

## Advanced Example: Workflow Factory

You can create a workflow factory that generates different workflows based on input parameters:

```typescript
const isMastra = (mastra: any): mastra is Mastra => {
  return mastra && typeof mastra === "object" && mastra instanceof Mastra;
};

const workflowFactory = new LegacyStep({
  id: "workflowFactory",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    workflowType: z.enum(["simple", "complex"]),
    inputData: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    result: z.any(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    if (!mastra) {
      throw new Error("Mastra instance not available");
    }

    if (!isMastra(mastra)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid Mastra instance");
    }

    // Create a new dynamic workflow based on the type
    const dynamicWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
      name: `dynamic-${context.workflowType}-workflow`,
      mastra,
      triggerSchema: z.object({
        input: z.string(),
      }),
    });

    if (context.workflowType === "simple") {
      // Simple workflow with a single step
      const simpleStep = new Step({
        id: "simpleStep",
        execute: async ({ context }) => {
          return {
            result: `Simple processing: ${context.triggerData.input}`,
          };
        },
      });

      dynamicWorkflow.step(simpleStep).commit();
    } else {
      // Complex workflow with multiple steps
      const step1 = new LegacyStep({
        id: "step1",
        outputSchema: z.object({
          intermediateResult: z.string(),
        }),
        execute: async ({ context }) => {
          return {
            intermediateResult: `First processing: ${context.triggerData.input}`,
          };
        },
      });

      const step2 = new LegacyStep({
        id: "step2",
        execute: async ({ context }) => {
          const intermediate = context.getStepResult(step1).intermediateResult;
          return {
            finalResult: `Second processing: ${intermediate}`,
          };
        },
      });

      dynamicWorkflow.step(step1).then(step2).commit();
    }

    // Execute the dynamic workflow
    const run = dynamicWorkflow.createRun();
    const result = await run.start({
      triggerData: {
        input: context.inputData,
      },
    });

    // Return the appropriate result based on workflow type
    if (context.workflowType === "simple") {
      return {
        // @ts-ignore
        result: result.results["simpleStep"]?.output,
      };
    } else {
      return {
        // @ts-ignore
        result: result.results["step2"]?.output,
      };
    }
  },
});
```

## Important Considerations

1. **Mastra Instance**: The `mastra` parameter in the `execute` function provides access to the Mastra instance, which is essential for creating dynamic workflows.

2. **Error Handling**: Always check if the Mastra instance is available before attempting to create a dynamic workflow.

3. **Resource Management**: Dynamic workflows consume resources, so be mindful of creating too many workflows in a single execution.

4. **Workflow Lifecycle**: Dynamic workflows are not automatically registered with the main Mastra instance. They exist only for the duration of the step execution unless you explicitly register them.

5. **Debugging**: Debugging dynamic workflows can be challenging. Consider adding detailed logging to track their creation and execution.

## Use Cases

- **Conditional Workflow Selection**: Choose different workflow patterns based on input data
- **Parameterized Workflows**: Create workflows with dynamic configurations
- **Workflow Templates**: Use templates to generate specialized workflows
- **Multi-tenant Applications**: Create isolated workflows for different tenants

## Conclusion

Dynamic workflows provide a powerful way to create flexible, adaptable workflow systems. By leveraging the Mastra instance within step execution, you can create workflows that respond to runtime conditions and requirements.

# Error Handling in Workflows (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows-legacy/error-handling

Robust error handling is essential for production workflows. Mastra provides several mechanisms to handle errors gracefully, allowing your workflows to recover from failures or gracefully degrade when necessary.

## Overview

Error handling in Mastra workflows can be implemented using:

1. **Step Retries** - Automatically retry failed steps
2. **Conditional Branching** - Create alternative paths based on step success or failure
3. **Error Monitoring** - Watch workflows for errors and handle them programmatically
4. **Result Status Checks** - Check the status of previous steps in subsequent steps

## Step Retries

Mastra provides a built-in retry mechanism for steps that fail due to transient errors. This is particularly useful for steps that interact with external services or resources that might experience temporary unavailability.

### Basic Retry Configuration

You can configure retries at the workflow level or for individual steps:

```typescript
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

// Workflow-level retry configuration
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 3, // Number of retry attempts
    delay: 1000, // Delay between retries in milliseconds
  },
});

// Step-level retry configuration (overrides workflow-level)
const apiStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "callApi",
  execute: async () => {
    // API call that might fail
  },
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 5, // This step will retry up to 5 times
    delay: 2000, // With a 2-second delay between retries
  },
});
```

For more details about step retries, see the [Step Retries](../../reference/legacyWorkflows/step-retries.mdx) reference.

## Conditional Branching

You can create alternative workflow paths based on the success or failure of previous steps using conditional logic:

```typescript
// Create a workflow with conditional branching
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "error-handling-workflow",
});

workflow
  .step(fetchDataStep)
  .then(processDataStep, {
    // Only execute processDataStep if fetchDataStep was successful
    when: ({ context }) => {
      return context.steps.fetchDataStep?.status === "success";
    },
  })
  .then(fallbackStep, {
    // Execute fallbackStep if fetchDataStep failed
    when: ({ context }) => {
      return context.steps.fetchDataStep?.status === "failed";
    },
  })
  .commit();
```

## Error Monitoring

You can monitor workflows for errors using the `watch` method:

```typescript
const { start, watch } = workflow.createRun();

watch(async ({ results }) => {
  // Check for any failed steps
  const failedSteps = Object.entries(results)
    .filter(([_, step]) => step.status === "failed")
    .map(([stepId]) => stepId);

  if (failedSteps.length > 0) {
    console.error(`Workflow has failed steps: ${failedSteps.join(", ")}`);
    // Take remedial action, such as alerting or logging
  }
});

await start();
```

## Handling Errors in Steps

Within a step's execution function, you can handle errors programmatically:

```typescript
const robustStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "robustStep",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    try {
      // Attempt the primary operation
      const result = await someRiskyOperation();
      return { success: true, data: result };
    } catch (error) {
      // Log the error
      console.error("Operation failed:", error);

      // Return a graceful fallback result instead of throwing
      return {
        success: false,
        error: error.message,
        fallbackData: "Default value",
      };
    }
  },
});
```

## Checking Previous Step Results

You can make decisions based on the results of previous steps:

```typescript
const finalStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "finalStep",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Check results of previous steps
    const step1Success = context.steps.step1?.status === "success";
    const step2Success = context.steps.step2?.status === "success";

    if (step1Success && step2Success) {
      // All steps succeeded
      return { status: "complete", result: "All operations succeeded" };
    } else if (step1Success) {
      // Only step1 succeeded
      return { status: "partial", result: "Partial completion" };
    } else {
      // Critical failure
      return { status: "failed", result: "Critical steps failed" };
    }
  },
});
```

## Best Practices for Error Handling

1. **Use retries for transient failures**: Configure retry policies for steps that might experience temporary issues.

2. **Provide fallback paths**: Design workflows with alternative paths for when critical steps fail.

3. **Be specific about error scenarios**: Use different handling strategies for different types of errors.

4. **Log errors comprehensively**: Include context information when logging errors to aid in debugging.

5. **Return meaningful data on failure**: When a step fails, return structured data about the failure to help downstream steps make decisions.

6. **Consider idempotency**: Ensure steps can be safely retried without causing duplicate side effects.

7. **Monitor workflow execution**: Use the `watch` method to actively monitor workflow execution and detect errors early.

## Advanced Error Handling

For more complex error handling scenarios, consider:

- **Implementing circuit breakers**: If a step fails repeatedly, stop retrying and use a fallback strategy
- **Adding timeout handling**: Set time limits for steps to prevent workflows from hanging indefinitely
- **Creating dedicated error recovery workflows**: For critical workflows, create separate recovery workflows that can be triggered when the main workflow fails

# Nested Workflows (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows-legacy/nested-workflows

Mastra allows you to use workflows as steps within other workflows, enabling you to create modular and reusable workflow components. This feature helps in organizing complex workflows into smaller, manageable pieces and promotes code reuse.

It is also visually easier to understand the flow of a workflow when you can see the nested workflows as steps in the parent workflow.

## Basic Usage

You can use a workflow as a step directly in another workflow using the `step()` method:

```typescript
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

// Create a nested workflow
const nestedWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({ name: "nested-workflow" })
  .step(stepA)
  .then(stepB)
  .commit();

// Use the nested workflow in a parent workflow
const parentWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({ name: "parent-workflow" })
  .step(nestedWorkflow, {
    variables: {
      city: {
        step: "trigger",
        path: "myTriggerInput",
      },
    },
  })
  .then(stepC)
  .commit();
```

When a workflow is used as a step:

- It is automatically converted to a step using the workflow's name as the step ID
- The workflow's results are available in the parent workflow's context
- The nested workflow's steps are executed in their defined order

## Accessing Results

Results from a nested workflow are available in the parent workflow's context under the nested workflow's name. The results include all step outputs from the nested workflow:

```typescript
const { results } = await parentWorkflow.start();
// Access nested workflow results
const nestedWorkflowResult = results["nested-workflow"];
if (nestedWorkflowResult.status === "success") {
  const nestedResults = nestedWorkflowResult.output.results;
}
```

## Control Flow with Nested Workflows

Nested workflows support all the control flow features available to regular steps:

### Parallel Execution

Multiple nested workflows can be executed in parallel:

```typescript
parentWorkflow
  .step(nestedWorkflowA)
  .step(nestedWorkflowB)
  .after([nestedWorkflowA, nestedWorkflowB])
  .step(finalStep);
```

Or using `step()` with an array of workflows:

```typescript
parentWorkflow.step([nestedWorkflowA, nestedWorkflowB]).then(finalStep);
```

In this case, `then()` will implicitly wait for all the workflows to finish before executing the final step.

### If-Else Branching

Nested workflows can be used in if-else branches using the new syntax that accepts both branches as arguments:

```typescript
// Create nested workflows for different paths
const workflowA = new LegacyWorkflow({ name: "workflow-a" })
  .step(stepA1)
  .then(stepA2)
  .commit();

const workflowB = new LegacyWorkflow({ name: "workflow-b" })
  .step(stepB1)
  .then(stepB2)
  .commit();

// Use the new if-else syntax with nested workflows
parentWorkflow
  .step(initialStep)
  .if(
    async ({ context }) => {
      // Your condition here
      return someCondition;
    },
    workflowA, // if branch
    workflowB, // else branch
  )
  .then(finalStep)
  .commit();
```

The new syntax is more concise and clearer when working with nested workflows. When the condition is:

- `true`: The first workflow (if branch) is executed
- `false`: The second workflow (else branch) is executed

The skipped workflow will have a status of `skipped` in the results:

The `.then(finalStep)` call following the if-else block will merge the if and else branches back into a single execution path.

### Looping

Nested workflows can use `.until()` and `.while()` loops same as any other step. One interesting new pattern is to pass a workflow directly as the loop-back argument to keep executing that nested workflow until something is true about its results:

```typescript
parentWorkflow
  .step(firstStep)
  .while(
    ({ context }) =>
      context.getStepResult("nested-workflow").output.results.someField ===
      "someValue",
    nestedWorkflow,
  )
  .step(finalStep)
  .commit();
```

## Watching Nested Workflows

You can watch the state changes of nested workflows using the `watch` method on the parent workflow. This is useful for monitoring the progress and state transitions of complex workflows:

```typescript
const parentWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({ name: "parent-workflow" })
  .step([nestedWorkflowA, nestedWorkflowB])
  .then(finalStep)
  .commit();

const run = parentWorkflow.createRun();
const unwatch = parentWorkflow.watch((state) => {
  console.log("Current state:", state.value);
  // Access nested workflow states in state.context
});

await run.start();
unwatch(); // Stop watching when done
```

## Suspending and Resuming

Nested workflows support suspension and resumption, allowing you to pause and continue workflow execution at specific points. You can suspend either the entire nested workflow or specific steps within it:

```typescript
// Define a step that may need to suspend
const suspendableStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "other",
  description: "Step that may need to suspend",
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    if (!wasSuspended) {
      wasSuspended = true;
      await suspend();
    }
    return { other: 26 };
  },
});

// Create a nested workflow with suspendable steps
const nestedWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({ name: "nested-workflow-a" })
  .step(startStep)
  .then(suspendableStep)
  .then(finalStep)
  .commit();

// Use in parent workflow
const parentWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({ name: "parent-workflow" })
  .step(beginStep)
  .then(nestedWorkflow)
  .then(lastStep)
  .commit();

// Start the workflow
const run = parentWorkflow.createRun();
const { runId, results } = await run.start({ triggerData: { startValue: 1 } });

// Check if a specific step in the nested workflow is suspended
if (results["nested-workflow-a"].output.results.other.status === "suspended") {
  // Resume the specific suspended step using dot notation
  const resumedResults = await run.resume({
    stepId: "nested-workflow-a.other",
    context: { startValue: 1 },
  });

  // The resumed results will contain the completed nested workflow
  expect(resumedResults.results["nested-workflow-a"].output.results).toEqual({
    start: { output: { newValue: 1 }, status: "success" },
    other: { output: { other: 26 }, status: "success" },
    final: { output: { finalValue: 27 }, status: "success" },
  });
}
```

When resuming a nested workflow:

- Use the nested workflow's name as the `stepId` when calling `resume()` to resume the entire workflow
- Use dot notation (`nested-workflow.step-name`) to resume a specific step within the nested workflow
- The nested workflow will continue from the suspended step with the provided context
- You can check the status of specific steps in the nested workflow's results using `results["nested-workflow"].output.results`

## Result Schemas and Mapping

Nested workflows can define their result schema and mapping, which helps in type safety and data transformation. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure the nested workflow's output matches a specific structure or when you need to transform the results before they're used in the parent workflow.

```typescript
// Create a nested workflow with result schema and mapping
const nestedWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "nested-workflow",
  result: {
    schema: z.object({
      total: z.number(),
      items: z.array(
        z.object({
          id: z.string(),
          value: z.number(),
        }),
      ),
    }),
    mapping: {
      // Map values from step results using variables syntax
      total: { step: "step-a", path: "count" },
      items: { step: "step-b", path: "items" },
    },
  },
})
  .step(stepA)
  .then(stepB)
  .commit();

// Use in parent workflow with type-safe results
const parentWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({ name: "parent-workflow" })
  .step(nestedWorkflow)
  .then(async ({ context }) => {
    const result = context.getStepResult("nested-workflow");
    // TypeScript knows the structure of result
    console.log(result.total); // number
    console.log(result.items); // Array<{ id: string, value: number }>
    return { success: true };
  })
  .commit();
```

## Best Practices

1. **Modularity**: Use nested workflows to encapsulate related steps and create reusable workflow components.
2. **Naming**: Give nested workflows descriptive names as they will be used as step IDs in the parent workflow.
3. **Error Handling**: Nested workflows propagate their errors to the parent workflow, so handle errors appropriately.
4. **State Management**: Each nested workflow maintains its own state but can access the parent workflow's context.
5. **Suspension**: When using suspension in nested workflows, consider the entire workflow's state and handle resumption appropriately.

## Example

Here's a complete example showing various features of nested workflows:

```typescript
const workflowA = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "workflow-a",
  result: {
    schema: z.object({
      activities: z.string(),
    }),
    mapping: {
      activities: {
        step: planActivities,
        path: "activities",
      },
    },
  },
})
  .step(fetchWeather)
  .then(planActivities)
  .commit();

const workflowB = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "workflow-b",
  result: {
    schema: z.object({
      activities: z.string(),
    }),
    mapping: {
      activities: {
        step: planActivities,
        path: "activities",
      },
    },
  },
})
  .step(fetchWeather)
  .then(planActivities)
  .commit();

const weatherWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "weather-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    cityA: z.string().describe("The city to get the weather for"),
    cityB: z.string().describe("The city to get the weather for"),
  }),
  result: {
    schema: z.object({
      activitiesA: z.string(),
      activitiesB: z.string(),
    }),
    mapping: {
      activitiesA: {
        step: workflowA,
        path: "result.activities",
      },
      activitiesB: {
        step: workflowB,
        path: "result.activities",
      },
    },
  },
})
  .step(workflowA, {
    variables: {
      city: {
        step: "trigger",
        path: "cityA",
      },
    },
  })
  .step(workflowB, {
    variables: {
      city: {
        step: "trigger",
        path: "cityB",
      },
    },
  });

weatherWorkflow.commit();
```

In this example:

1. We define schemas for type safety across all workflows
2. Each step has proper input and output schemas
3. The nested workflows have their own trigger schemas and result mappings
4. Data is passed through using variables syntax in the `.step()` calls
5. The main workflow combines data from both nested workflows

Workflows in Mastra help you orchestrate complex sequences of operations with features like branching, parallel execution, resource suspension, and more.

## When to use workflows

Most AI applications need more than a single call to a language model. You may want to run multiple steps, conditionally skip certain paths, or even pause execution altogether until you receive user input. Sometimes your agent tool calling is not accurate enough.

Mastra's workflow system provides:

- A standardized way to define steps and link them together.
- Support for both simple (linear) and advanced (branching, parallel) paths.
- Debugging and observability features to track each workflow run.

## Example

To create a workflow, you define one or more steps, link them, and then commit the workflow before starting it.

### Breaking Down the Workflow (Legacy)

Let's examine each part of the workflow creation process:

#### 1. Creating the Workflow

Here's how you define a workflow in Mastra. The `name` field determines the workflow's API endpoint (`/workflows/$NAME/`), while the `triggerSchema` defines the structure of the workflow's trigger data:

```ts filename="src/mastra/workflow/index.ts"
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

const myWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputValue: z.number(),
  }),
});
```

#### 2. Defining Steps

Now, we'll define the workflow's steps. Each step can have its own input and output schemas. Here, `stepOne` doubles an input value, and `stepTwo` increments that result if `stepOne` was successful. (To keep things simple, we aren't making any LLM calls in this example):

```ts filename="src/mastra/workflow/index.ts"
const stepOne = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepOne",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    doubledValue: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const doubledValue = context.triggerData.inputValue * 2;
    return { doubledValue };
  },
});

const stepTwo = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepTwo",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const doubledValue = context.getStepResult(stepOne)?.doubledValue;
    if (!doubledValue) {
      return { incrementedValue: 0 };
    }
    return {
      incrementedValue: doubledValue + 1,
    };
  },
});
```

#### 3. Linking Steps

Now, let's create the control flow, and "commit" (finalize the workflow). In this case, `stepOne` runs first and is followed by `stepTwo`.

```ts filename="src/mastra/workflow/index.ts"
myWorkflow.step(stepOne).then(stepTwo).commit();
```

### Register the Workflow

Register your workflow with Mastra to enable logging and telemetry:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { myWorkflow },
});
```

The workflow can also have the mastra instance injected into the context in the case where you need to create dynamic workflows:

```ts filename="src/mastra/workflow/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

const mastra = new Mastra();

const myWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  mastra,
});
```

### Executing the Workflow

Execute your workflow programmatically or via API:

```ts showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/run-workflow.ts" copy
import { mastra } from "./index";

// Get the workflow
const myWorkflow = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("myWorkflow");
const { runId, start } = myWorkflow.createRun();

// Start the workflow execution
await start({ triggerData: { inputValue: 45 } });
```

Or use the API (requires running `mastra dev`):

// Create workflow run

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:5000/api/workflows/myWorkflow/start-async' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
       "inputValue": 45
     }'
```

This example shows the essentials: define your workflow, add steps, commit the workflow, then execute it.

## Defining Steps

The basic building block of a workflow [is a step](./steps.mdx). Steps are defined using schemas for inputs and outputs, and can fetch prior step results.

## Control Flow

Workflows let you define a [control flow](./control-flow.mdx) to chain steps together in with parallel steps, branching paths, and more.

## Workflow Variables

When you need to map data between steps or create dynamic data flows, [workflow variables](./variables.mdx) provide a powerful mechanism for passing information from one step to another and accessing nested properties within step outputs.

## Suspend and Resume

When you need to pause execution for external data, user input, or asynchronous events, Mastra [supports suspension at any step](./suspend-and-resume.mdx), persisting the state of the workflow so you can resume it later.

## Observability and Debugging

Mastra workflows automatically [log the input and output of each step within a workflow run](../../reference/observability/otel-config.mdx), allowing you to send this data to your preferred logging, telemetry, or observability tools.

You can:

- Track the status of each step (e.g., `success`, `error`, or `suspended`).
- Store run-specific metadata for analysis.
- Integrate with third-party observability platforms like Datadog or New Relic by forwarding logs.

title: "Runtime variables - dependency injection | Workflows (Legacy) | Mastra Docs"
description: Learn how to use Mastra's dependency injection system to provide runtime configuration to workflows and steps.
---

# Workflow Runtime Variables (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows-legacy/runtime-variables

Mastra provides a powerful dependency injection system that enables you to configure your workflows and steps with runtime variables. This feature is essential for creating flexible and reusable workflows that can adapt their behavior based on runtime configuration.

## Overview

The dependency injection system allows you to:

1. Pass runtime configuration variables to workflows through a type-safe runtimeContext
2. Access these variables within step execution contexts
3. Modify workflow behavior without changing the underlying code
4. Share configuration across multiple steps within the same workflow

## Basic Usage

```typescript
const myWorkflow = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("myWorkflow");
const { runId, start, resume } = myWorkflow.createRun();

// Define your runtimeContext's type structure
type WorkflowRuntimeContext = {
  multiplier: number;
};

const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext<WorkflowRuntimeContext>();
runtimeContext.set("multiplier", 5);

// Start the workflow execution with runtimeContext
await start({
  triggerData: { inputValue: 45 },
  runtimeContext,
});
```

## Using with REST API

Here's how to dynamically set a multiplier value from an HTTP header:

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/di";
import { workflow as myWorkflow } from "./workflows";

// Define runtimeContext type with clear, descriptive types
type WorkflowRuntimeContext = {
  multiplier: number;
};

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: {
    myWorkflow,
  },
  server: {
    middleware: [
      async (c, next) => {
        const multiplier = c.req.header("x-multiplier");
        const runtimeContext = c.get<WorkflowRuntimeContext>("runtimeContext");

        // Parse and validate the multiplier value
        const multiplierValue = parseInt(multiplier || "1", 10);
        if (isNaN(multiplierValue)) {
          throw new Error("Invalid multiplier value");
        }

        runtimeContext.set("multiplier", multiplierValue);

        await next(); // Don't forget to call next()
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Creating Steps with Variables

Steps can access runtimeContext variables and must conform to the workflow's runtimeContext type:

```typescript
import { LegacyStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define step input/output types
interface StepInput {
  inputValue: number;
}

interface StepOutput {
  incrementedValue: number;
}

const stepOne = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepOne",
  description: "Multiply the input value by the configured multiplier",
  execute: async ({ context, runtimeContext }) => {
    try {
      // Type-safe access to runtimeContext variables
      const multiplier = runtimeContext.get("multiplier");
      if (multiplier === undefined) {
        throw new Error("Multiplier not configured in runtimeContext");
      }

      // Get and validate input
      const inputValue =
        context.getStepResult<StepInput>("trigger")?.inputValue;
      if (inputValue === undefined) {
        throw new Error("Input value not provided");
      }

      const result: StepOutput = {
        incrementedValue: inputValue * multiplier,
      };

      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error in stepOne: ${error.message}`);
      throw error;
    }
  },
});
```

## Error Handling

When working with runtime variables in workflows, it's important to handle potential errors:

1. **Missing Variables**: Always check if required variables exist in the runtimeContext
2. **Type Mismatches**: Use TypeScript's type system to catch type errors at compile time
3. **Invalid Values**: Validate variable values before using them in your steps

```typescript
// Example of defensive programming with runtimeContext variables
const multiplier = runtimeContext.get("multiplier");
if (multiplier === undefined) {
  throw new Error("Multiplier not configured in runtimeContext");
}

// Type and value validation
if (typeof multiplier !== "number" || multiplier <= 0) {
  throw new Error(`Invalid multiplier value: ${multiplier}`);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Type Safety**: Always define proper types for your runtimeContext and step inputs/outputs
2. **Validation**: Validate all inputs and runtimeContext variables before using them
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in your steps
4. **Documentation**: Document the expected runtimeContext variables for each workflow
5. **Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults when possible

# Defining Steps in a Workflow (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows-legacy/steps

When you build a workflow, you typically break down operations into smaller tasks that can be linked and reused. Steps provide a structured way to manage these tasks by defining inputs, outputs, and execution logic.

The code below shows how to define these steps inline or separately.

## Inline Step Creation

You can create steps directly within your workflow using `.step()` and `.then()`. This code shows how to define, link, and execute two steps in sequence.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

export const myWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputValue: z.number(),
  }),
});

myWorkflow
  .step(
    new LegacyStep({
      id: "stepOne",
      outputSchema: z.object({
        doubledValue: z.number(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ context }) => ({
        doubledValue: context.triggerData.inputValue * 2,
      }),
    }),
  )
  .then(
    new LegacyStep({
      id: "stepTwo",
      outputSchema: z.object({
        incrementedValue: z.number(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ context }) => {
        if (context.steps.stepOne.status !== "success") {
          return { incrementedValue: 0 };
        }

        return {
          incrementedValue: context.steps.stepOne.output.doubledValue + 1,
        };
      },
    }),
  )
  .commit();

// Register the workflow with Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { myWorkflow },
});
```

## Creating Steps Separately

If you prefer to manage your step logic in separate entities, you can define steps outside and then add them to your workflow. This code shows how to define steps independently and link them afterward.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define steps separately
const stepOne = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepOne",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    doubledValue: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => ({
    doubledValue: context.triggerData.inputValue * 2,
  }),
});

const stepTwo = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepTwo",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    incrementedValue: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    if (context.steps.stepOne.status !== "success") {
      return { incrementedValue: 0 };
    }
    return { incrementedValue: context.steps.stepOne.output.doubledValue + 1 };
  },
});

// Build the workflow
const myWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputValue: z.number(),
  }),
});

myWorkflow.step(stepOne).then(stepTwo);
myWorkflow.commit();

// Register the workflow with Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { myWorkflow },
});
```

title: "Suspend & Resume Workflows (Legacy) | Human-in-the-Loop | Mastra Docs"
description: "Suspend and resume in Mastra workflows allows you to pause execution while waiting for external input or resources."
---

# Suspend and Resume in Workflows (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows-legacy/suspend-and-resume

Complex workflows often need to pause execution while waiting for external input or resources.

Mastra's suspend and resume features let you pause workflow execution at any step, persist the workflow snapshot to storage, and resume execution from the saved snapshot when ready.
This entire process is automatically managed by Mastra. No config needed, or manual step required from the user.

Storing the workflow snapshot to storage (LibSQL by default) means that the workflow state is permanently preserved across sessions, deployments, and server restarts. This persistence is crucial for workflows that might remain suspended for minutes, hours, or even days while waiting for external input or resources.

## When to Use Suspend/Resume

Common scenarios for suspending workflows include:

- Waiting for human approval or input
- Pausing until external API resources become available
- Collecting additional data needed for later steps
- Rate limiting or throttling expensive operations
- Handling event-driven processes with external triggers

## Basic Suspend Example

Here's a simple workflow that suspends when a value is too low and resumes when given a higher value:

```typescript
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

const stepTwo = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepTwo",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    incrementedValue: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    if (context.steps.stepOne.status !== "success") {
      return { incrementedValue: 0 };
    }

    const currentValue = context.steps.stepOne.output.doubledValue;

    if (currentValue < 100) {
      await suspend();
      return { incrementedValue: 0 };
    }
    return { incrementedValue: currentValue + 1 };
  },
});
```

## Async/Await Based Flow

The suspend and resume mechanism in Mastra uses an async/await pattern that makes it intuitive to implement complex workflows with suspension points. The code structure naturally reflects the execution flow.

### How It Works

1. A step's execution function receives a `suspend` function in its parameters
2. When called with `await suspend()`, the workflow pauses at that point
3. The workflow state is persisted
4. Later, the workflow can be resumed by calling `workflow.resume()` with the appropriate parameters
5. Execution continues from the point after the `suspend()` call

### Example with Multiple Suspension Points

Here's an example of a workflow with multiple steps that can suspend:

```typescript
// Define steps with suspend capability
const promptAgentStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "promptAgent",
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    // Some condition that determines if we need to suspend
    if (needHumanInput) {
      // Optionally pass payload data that will be stored with suspended state
      await suspend({ requestReason: "Need human input for prompt" });
      // Code after suspend() will execute when the step is resumed
      return { modelOutput: context.userInput };
    }
    return { modelOutput: "AI generated output" };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({ modelOutput: z.string() }),
});

const improveResponseStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "improveResponse",
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    // Another condition for suspension
    if (needFurtherRefinement) {
      await suspend();
      return { improvedOutput: context.refinedOutput };
    }
    return { improvedOutput: "Improved output" };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({ improvedOutput: z.string() }),
});

// Build the workflow
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "multi-suspend-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({ input: z.string() }),
});

workflow
  .step(getUserInput)
  .then(promptAgentStep)
  .then(evaluateTone)
  .then(improveResponseStep)
  .then(evaluateImproved)
  .commit();

// Register the workflow with Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { workflow },
});
```

### Starting and Resuming the Workflow

```typescript
// Get the workflow and create a run
const wf = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("multi-suspend-workflow");
const run = wf.createRun();

// Start the workflow
const initialResult = await run.start({
  triggerData: { input: "initial input" },
});

let promptAgentStepResult = initialResult.activePaths.get("promptAgent");
let promptAgentResumeResult = undefined;

// Check if a step is suspended
if (promptAgentStepResult?.status === "suspended") {
  console.log("Workflow suspended at promptAgent step");

  // Resume the workflow with new context
  const resumeResult = await run.resume({
    stepId: "promptAgent",
    context: { userInput: "Human provided input" },
  });

  promptAgentResumeResult = resumeResult;
}

const improveResponseStepResult =
  promptAgentResumeResult?.activePaths.get("improveResponse");

if (improveResponseStepResult?.status === "suspended") {
  console.log("Workflow suspended at improveResponse step");

  // Resume again with different context
  const finalResult = await run.resume({
    stepId: "improveResponse",
    context: { refinedOutput: "Human refined output" },
  });

  console.log("Workflow completed:", finalResult?.results);
}
```

## Event-Based Suspension and Resumption

In addition to manually suspending steps, Mastra provides event-based suspension through the `afterEvent` method. This allows workflows to automatically suspend and wait for a specific event to occur before continuing.

### Using afterEvent and resumeWithEvent

The `afterEvent` method automatically creates a suspension point in your workflow that waits for a specific event to occur. When the event happens, you can use `resumeWithEvent` to continue the workflow with the event data.

Here's how it works:

1. Define events in your workflow configuration
2. Use `afterEvent` to create a suspension point waiting for that event
3. When the event occurs, call `resumeWithEvent` with the event name and data

### Example: Event-Based Workflow

```typescript
// Define steps
const getUserInput = new LegacyStep({
  id: "getUserInput",
  execute: async () => ({ userInput: "initial input" }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ userInput: z.string() }),
});

const processApproval = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processApproval",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Access the event data from the context
    const approvalData = context.inputData?.resumedEvent;
    return {
      approved: approvalData?.approved,
      approvedBy: approvalData?.approverName,
    };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({
    approved: z.boolean(),
    approvedBy: z.string(),
  }),
});

// Create workflow with event definition
const approvalWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "approval-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({ requestId: z.string() }),
  events: {
    approvalReceived: {
      schema: z.object({
        approved: z.boolean(),
        approverName: z.string(),
      }),
    },
  },
});

// Build workflow with event-based suspension
approvalWorkflow
  .step(getUserInput)
  .afterEvent("approvalReceived") // Workflow will automatically suspend here
  .step(processApproval) // This step runs after the event is received
  .commit();
```

### Running an Event-Based Workflow

```typescript
// Get the workflow
const workflow = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("approval-workflow");
const run = workflow.createRun();

// Start the workflow
const initialResult = await run.start({
  triggerData: { requestId: "request-123" },
});

console.log("Workflow started, waiting for approval event");
console.log(initialResult.results);
// Output will show the workflow is suspended at the event step:
// {
//   getUserInput: { status: 'success', output: { userInput: 'initial input' } },
//   __approvalReceived_event: { status: 'suspended' }
// }

// Later, when the approval event occurs:
const resumeResult = await run.resumeWithEvent("approvalReceived", {
  approved: true,
  approverName: "Jane Doe",
});

console.log("Workflow resumed with event data:", resumeResult.results);
// Output will show the completed workflow:
// {
//   getUserInput: { status: 'success', output: { userInput: 'initial input' } },
//   __approvalReceived_event: { status: 'success', output: { executed: true, resumedEvent: { approved: true, approverName: 'Jane Doe' } } },
//   processApproval: { status: 'success', output: { approved: true, approvedBy: 'Jane Doe' } }
// }
```

### Key Points About Event-Based Workflows

- The `suspend()` function can optionally take a payload object that will be stored with the suspended state
- Code after the `await suspend()` call will not execute until the step is resumed
- When a step is suspended, its status becomes `'suspended'` in the workflow results
- When resumed, the step's status changes from `'suspended'` to `'success'` once completed
- The `resume()` method requires the `stepId` to identify which suspended step to resume
- You can provide new context data when resuming that will be merged with existing step results

- Events must be defined in the workflow configuration with a schema
- The `afterEvent` method creates a special suspended step that waits for the event
- The event step is automatically named `__eventName_event` (e.g., `__approvalReceived_event`)
- Use `resumeWithEvent` to provide event data and continue the workflow
- Event data is validated against the schema defined for that event
- The event data is available in the context as `inputData.resumedEvent`

## Storage for Suspend and Resume

When a workflow is suspended using `await suspend()`, Mastra automatically persists the entire workflow state to storage. This is essential for workflows that might remain suspended for extended periods, as it ensures the state is preserved across application restarts or server instances.

### Default Storage: LibSQL

By default, Mastra uses LibSQL as its storage engine:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    url: "file:./storage.db", // Local file-based database for development
    // For production, use a persistent URL:
    // url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    // authToken: process.env.DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN, // Optional for authenticated connections
  }),
});
```

The LibSQL storage can be configured in different modes:

- In-memory database (testing): `:memory:`
- File-based database (development): `file:storage.db`
- Remote database (production): URLs like `libsql://your-database.turso.io`

### Alternative Storage Options

#### Upstash (Redis-Compatible)

For serverless applications or environments where Redis is preferred:

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/upstash@latest
```

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { UpstashStore } from "@mastra/upstash";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new UpstashStore({
    url: process.env.UPSTASH_URL,
    token: process.env.UPSTASH_TOKEN,
  }),
});
```

### Storage Considerations

- All storage options support suspend and resume functionality identically
- The workflow state is automatically serialized and saved when suspended
- No additional configuration is needed for suspend/resume to work with storage
- Choose your storage option based on your infrastructure, scaling needs, and existing technology stack

## Watching and Resuming

To handle suspended workflows, use the `watch` method to monitor workflow status per run and `resume` to continue execution:

```typescript
import { mastra } from "./index";

// Get the workflow
const myWorkflow = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("myWorkflow");
const { start, watch, resume } = myWorkflow.createRun();

// Start watching the workflow before executing it
watch(async ({ activePaths }) => {
  const isStepTwoSuspended = activePaths.get("stepTwo")?.status === "suspended";
  if (isStepTwoSuspended) {
    console.log("Workflow suspended, resuming with new value");

    // Resume the workflow with new context
    await resume({
      stepId: "stepTwo",
      context: { secondValue: 100 },
    });
  }
});

// Start the workflow execution
await start({ triggerData: { inputValue: 45 } });
```

### Watching and Resuming Event-Based Workflows

You can use the same watching pattern with event-based workflows:

```typescript
const { start, watch, resumeWithEvent } = workflow.createRun();

// Watch for suspended event steps
watch(async ({ activePaths }) => {
  const isApprovalReceivedSuspended =
    activePaths.get("__approvalReceived_event")?.status === "suspended";
  if (isApprovalReceivedSuspended) {
    console.log("Workflow waiting for approval event");

    // In a real scenario, you would wait for the actual event to occur
    // For example, this could be triggered by a webhook or user interaction
    setTimeout(async () => {
      await resumeWithEvent("approvalReceived", {
        approved: true,
        approverName: "Auto Approver",
      });
    }, 5000); // Simulate event after 5 seconds
  }
});

// Start the workflow
await start({ triggerData: { requestId: "auto-123" } });
```

description: "Learn how to use workflow variables to map data between steps and create dynamic data flows in your Mastra workflows."
---

# Data Mapping with Workflow Variables
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/workflows-legacy/variables

Workflow variables in Mastra provide a powerful mechanism for mapping data between steps, allowing you to create dynamic data flows and pass information from one step to another.

## Understanding Workflow Variables

In Mastra workflows, variables serve as a way to:

- Map data from trigger inputs to step inputs
- Pass outputs from one step to inputs of another step
- Access nested properties within step outputs
- Create more flexible and reusable workflow steps

## Using Variables for Data Mapping

### Basic Variable Mapping

You can map data between steps using the `variables` property when adding a step to your workflow:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/index.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "data-mapping-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputData: z.string(),
  }),
});

workflow
  .step(step1, {
    variables: {
      // Map trigger data to step input
      inputData: { step: "trigger", path: "inputData" },
    },
  })
  .then(step2, {
    variables: {
      // Map output from step1 to input for step2
      previousValue: { step: step1, path: "outputField" },
    },
  })
  .commit();

// Register the workflow with Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { workflow },
});
```

### Accessing Nested Properties

You can access nested properties using dot notation in the `path` field:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/index.ts" copy
workflow
  .step(step1)
  .then(step2, {
    variables: {
      // Access a nested property from step1's output
      nestedValue: { step: step1, path: "nested.deeply.value" },
    },
  })
  .commit();
```

### Mapping Entire Objects

You can map an entire object by using `.` as the path:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/index.ts" copy
workflow
  .step(step1, {
    variables: {
      // Map the entire trigger data object
      triggerData: { step: "trigger", path: "." },
    },
  })
  .commit();
```

### Variables in Loops

Variables can also be passed to `while` and `until` loops. This is useful for passing data between iterations or from outside steps:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/loop-variables.ts" copy
// Step that increments a counter
const incrementStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "increment",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    // Previous value from last iteration
    prevValue: z.number().optional(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    // Updated counter value
    updatedCounter: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const { prevValue = 0 } = context.inputData;
    return { updatedCounter: prevValue + 1 };
  },
});

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "counter",
});

workflow.step(incrementStep).while(
  async ({ context }) => {
    // Continue while counter is less than 10
    const result = context.getStepResult(incrementStep);
    return (result?.updatedCounter ?? 0) < 10;
  },
  incrementStep,
  {
    // Pass previous value to next iteration
    prevValue: {
      step: incrementStep,
      path: "updatedCounter",
    },
  },
);
```

## Variable Resolution

When a workflow executes, Mastra resolves variables at runtime by:

1. Identifying the source step specified in the `step` property
2. Retrieving the output from that step
3. Navigating to the specified property using the `path`
4. Injecting the resolved value into the target step's context as the `inputData` property

## Examples

### Mapping from Trigger Data

This example shows how to map data from the workflow trigger to a step:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/trigger-mapping.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define a step that needs user input
const processUserInput = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processUserInput",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // The inputData will be available in context because of the variable mapping
    const { inputData } = context.inputData;

    return {
      processedData: `Processed: ${inputData}`,
    };
  },
});

// Create the workflow
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "trigger-mapping",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputData: z.string(),
  }),
});

// Map the trigger data to the step
workflow
  .step(processUserInput, {
    variables: {
      inputData: { step: "trigger", path: "inputData" },
    },
  })
  .commit();

// Register the workflow with Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { workflow },
});
```

### Mapping Between Steps

This example demonstrates mapping data from one step to another:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/step-mapping.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Step 1: Generate data
const generateData = new LegacyStep({
  id: "generateData",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    nested: z.object({
      value: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  execute: async () => {
    return {
      nested: {
        value: "step1-data",
      },
    };
  },
});

// Step 2: Process the data from step 1
const processData = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processData",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    previousValue: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // previousValue will be available because of the variable mapping
    const { previousValue } = context.inputData;

    return {
      result: `Processed: ${previousValue}`,
    };
  },
});

// Create the workflow
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "step-mapping",
});

// Map data from step1 to step2
workflow
  .step(generateData)
  .then(processData, {
    variables: {
      // Map the nested.value property from generateData's output
      previousValue: { step: generateData, path: "nested.value" },
    },
  })
  .commit();

// Register the workflow with Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { workflow },
});
```

## Type Safety

Mastra provides type safety for variable mappings when using TypeScript:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/type-safe.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define schemas for better type safety
const triggerSchema = z.object({
  inputValue: z.string(),
});

type TriggerType = z.infer<typeof triggerSchema>;

// Step with typed context
const step1 = new LegacyStep({
  id: "step1",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    nested: z.object({
      value: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // TypeScript knows the shape of triggerData
    const triggerData = context.getStepResult<TriggerType>("trigger");

    return {
      nested: {
        value: `processed-${triggerData?.inputValue}`,
      },
    };
  },
});

// Create the workflow with the schema
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "type-safe-workflow",
  triggerSchema,
});

workflow.step(step1).commit();

// Register the workflow with Mastra
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { workflow },
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Validate Inputs and Outputs**: Use `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` to ensure data consistency.

2. **Keep Mappings Simple**: Avoid overly complex nested paths when possible.

3. **Consider Default Values**: Handle cases where mapped data might be undefined.

## Comparison with Direct Context Access

While you can access previous step results directly via `context.steps`, using variable mappings offers several advantages:

| Feature     | Variable Mapping                            | Direct Context Access           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Clarity     | Explicit data dependencies                  | Implicit dependencies           |
| Reusability | Steps can be reused with different mappings | Steps are tightly coupled       |
| Type Safety | Better TypeScript integration               | Requires manual type assertions |

import { GithubLink } from "@/components/github-link";

# Example: Categorizing Birds with an AI Agent
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/agents/bird-checker

We will get a random image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) that matches a selected query and uses a [Mastra AI Agent](/docs/agents/overview.md) to determine if it is a bird or not.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { z } from "zod";

export type Image = {
  alt_description: string;
  urls: {
    regular: string;
    raw: string;
  };
  user: {
    first_name: string;
    links: {
      html: string;

  };
};

export type ImageResponse<T, K> =

const getRandomImage = async ({

  query: string;
}): Promise<ImageResponse<Image, string>> => {
  const page = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
  const order_by = Math.random() < 0.5 ? "relevant" : "latest";

title: "Example: Deploying an MCPServer | Agents | Mastra Docs"
description: Example of setting up, building, and deploying a Mastra MCPServer using the stdio transport and publishing it to NPM.
---

import { GithubLink } from "@/components/github-link";

# Example: Deploying an MCPServer
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/agents/deploying-mcp-server

This example guides you through setting up a basic Mastra MCPServer using the stdio transport, building it, and preparing it for deployment, such as publishing to NPM.

## Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
pnpm add @mastra/mcp @mastra/core tsup
```

## Set up MCP Server

1.  Create a file for your stdio server, for example, `/src/mastra/stdio.ts`.

2.  Add the following code to the file. Remember to import your actual Mastra tools and name the server appropriately.

    ```typescript filename="src/mastra/stdio.ts" copy
    #!/usr/bin/env node
    import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
    import { weatherTool } from "./tools";

    const server = new MCPServer({
      name: "my-mcp-server",
      version: "1.0.0",
      tools: { weatherTool },
    });

    server.startStdio().catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error running MCP server:", error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
    ```

3.  Update your `package.json` to include the `bin` entry pointing to your built server file and a script to build the server.

```json filename="package.json" copy
{
  "bin": "dist/stdio.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build:mcp": "tsup src/mastra/stdio.ts --format esm --no-splitting --dts && chmod +x dist/stdio.js"
  }
}
```

4.  Run the build command:

    ```bash
    pnpm run build:mcp
    ```

    This will compile your server code and make the output file executable.

## Deploying to NPM

To make your MCP server available for others (or yourself) to use via `npx` or as a dependency, you can publish it to NPM.

1.  Ensure you have an NPM account and are logged in (`npm login`).
2.  Make sure your package name in `package.json` is unique and available.
3.  Run the publish command from your project root after building:

    ```bash
    npm publish --access public
    ```

    For more details on publishing packages, refer to the [NPM documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-publishing-scoped-public-packages).

## Use the Deployed MCP Server

Once published, your MCP server can be used by an `MCPClient` by specifying the command to run your package. You can also use any other MCP client like Claude desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf.

```typescript
import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";

const mcp = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    // Give this MCP server instance a name
    yourServerName: {
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "@your-org-name/your-package-name@latest"], // Replace with your package name
    },
  },
});

// You can then get tools or toolsets from this configuration to use in your agent
const tools = await mcp.getTools();
const toolsets = await mcp.getToolsets();
```

Note: If you published without an organization scope, the `args` might just be `["-y", "your-package-name@latest"]`.

title: Dynamic Agents Example | Agents | Mastra Docs
description: Learn how to create and configure dynamic agents using runtime context in Mastra.
---

# Dynamic Agents Example
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/agents/dynamic-agents

First, let's define our runtime context type:

```typescript
import { Agent, RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core";
import { z } from "zod";

type SupportRuntimeContext = {
  "user-tier": "free" | "pro" | "enterprise";
  language: "en" | "es" | "fr";
  "user-id": string;
};
```

Next, let's create our dynamic support agent with its configuration:

```typescript
const supportAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Dynamic Support Agent",

  instructions: async ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    const userTier = runtimeContext.get("user-tier");
    const language = runtimeContext.get("language");

    return `You are a customer support agent for our SaaS platform.
    The current user is on the ${userTier} tier and prefers ${language} language.
    
    For ${userTier} tier users:
    ${userTier === "free" ? "- Provide basic support and documentation links" : ""}
    ${userTier === "pro" ? "- Offer detailed technical support and best practices" : ""}
    ${userTier === "enterprise" ? "- Provide priority support with custom solutions" : ""}
    
    Always respond in ${language} language.`;
  },

  model: ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    const userTier = runtimeContext.get("user-tier");
    return userTier === "enterprise"
      ? openai("gpt-4")
      : openai("gpt-3.5-turbo");
  },

  tools: ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    const userTier = runtimeContext.get("user-tier");
    const baseTools = [knowledgeBase, ticketSystem];

    if (userTier === "pro" || userTier === "enterprise") {
      baseTools.push(advancedAnalytics);
    }

    if (userTier === "enterprise") {
      baseTools.push(customIntegration);
    }

    return baseTools;
  },
});
```

RuntimeContext can be passed from the client/server directly to your agent generate and stream calls

```typescript
async function handleSupportRequest(userId: string, message: string) {
  const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext<SupportRuntimeContext>();

  runtimeContext.set("user-id", userId);
  runtimeContext.set("user-tier", await getUserTier(userId));
  runtimeContext.set("language", await getUserLanguage(userId));

  const response = await supportAgent.generate(message, {
    runtimeContext,
  });

  return response.text;
}
```

RuntimeContext can also be set from the server middleware layer

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { registerApiRoute } from "@mastra/core/server";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: {
    support: supportAgent,
  },
  server: {
    middleware: [
      async (c, next) => {
        const userId = c.req.header("X-User-ID");
        const runtimeContext = c.get<SupportRuntimeContext>("runtimeContext");

        // Set user tier based on subscription
        const userTier = await getUserTier(userId);
        runtimeContext.set("user-tier", userTier);

        // Set language based on user preferences
        const language = await getUserLanguage(userId);
        runtimeContext.set("language", language);

        // Set user ID
        runtimeContext.set("user-id", userId);

        await next();
      },
    ],
    apiRoutes: [
      registerApiRoute("/support", {
        method: "POST",
        handler: async (c) => {
          const { userId, message } = await c.req.json();

          try {
            const response = await handleSupportRequest(userId, message);
            return c.json({ response });
          } catch (error) {
            return c.json({ error: "Failed to process support request" }, 500);
          }
        },
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

## Usage Example

This example shows how a single agent can handle different types of users and scenarios by leveraging runtime context, making it more flexible and maintainable than creating separate agents for each use case.

# Hierarchical Multi-Agent System
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/agents/hierarchical-multi-agent

This example demonstrates how to create a hierarchical multi-agent system where agents interact through tool functions, with one agent coordinating the work of others.

The system consists of three agents:

1. A Publisher agent (supervisor) that orchestrates the process
2. A Copywriter agent that writes the initial content
3. An Editor agent that refines the content

First, define the Copywriter agent and its tool:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";

const copywriterAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Copywriter",
  instructions: "You are a copywriter agent that writes blog post copy.",
  model: anthropic("claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"),
});

const copywriterTool = createTool({
  id: "copywriter-agent",
  description: "Calls the copywriter agent to write blog post copy.",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    topic: z.string().describe("Blog post topic"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    copy: z.string().describe("Blog post copy"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const result = await copywriterAgent.generate(
      `Create a blog post about ${context.topic}`,
    );
    return { copy: result.text };
  },
});
```

Next, define the Editor agent and its tool:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const editorAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Editor",
  instructions: "You are an editor agent that edits blog post copy.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

const editorTool = createTool({
  id: "editor-agent",
  description: "Calls the editor agent to edit blog post copy.",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    copy: z.string().describe("Blog post copy"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    copy: z.string().describe("Edited blog post copy"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const result = await editorAgent.generate(
      `Edit the following blog post only returning the edited copy: ${context.copy}`,
    );
    return { copy: result.text };
  },
});
```

Finally, create the Publisher agent that coordinates the others:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const publisherAgent = new Agent({
  name: "publisherAgent",
  instructions:
    "You are a publisher agent that first calls the copywriter agent to write blog post copy about a specific topic and then calls the editor agent to edit the copy. Just return the final edited copy.",
  model: anthropic("claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"),
  tools: { copywriterTool, editorTool },
});

const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { publisherAgent },
});
```

To use the entire system:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
async function main() {
  const agent = mastra.getAgent("publisherAgent");
  const result = await agent.generate(
    "Write a blog post about React JavaScript frameworks. Only return the final edited copy.",
  );
  console.log(result.text);
}

main();
```

import { GithubLink } from "@/components/github-link";

# Multi-Agent Workflow
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/agents/multi-agent-workflow

This example demonstrates how to create an agentic workflow with work product being passed between multiple agents with a worker agent and a supervisor agent.

In this example, we create a sequential workflow that calls two agents in order:

1. A Copywriter agent that writes the initial blog post
2. An Editor agent that refines the content

First, import the required dependencies:

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createStep, createWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";
```

Create the copywriter agent that will generate the initial blog post:

```typescript
const copywriterAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Copywriter",
  instructions: "You are a copywriter agent that writes blog post copy.",
  model: anthropic("claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"),
});
```

Define the copywriter step that executes the agent and handles the response:

```typescript
const copywriterStep = createStep({
  id: "copywriterStep",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    topic: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    copy: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    if (!inputData?.topic) {
      throw new Error("Topic not found in trigger data");
    }
    const result = await copywriterAgent.generate(
      `Create a blog post about ${inputData.topic}`,
    );
    console.log("copywriter result", result.text);
    return {
      copy: result.text,
    };
  },
});
```

Set up the editor agent to refine the copywriter's content:

```typescript
const editorAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Editor",
  instructions: "You are an editor agent that edits blog post copy.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});
```

Create the editor step that processes the copywriter's output:

```typescript
const editorStep = createStep({
  id: "editorStep",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    copy: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    finalCopy: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const copy = inputData?.copy;

    const result = await editorAgent.generate(
      `Edit the following blog post only returning the edited copy: ${copy}`,
    );
    console.log("editor result", result.text);
    return {
      finalCopy: result.text,
    };
  },
});
```

Configure the workflow and execute the steps:

```typescript
const myWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "my-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    topic: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    finalCopy: z.string(),
  }),
});

// Run steps sequentially.
myWorkflow.then(copywriterStep).then(editorStep).commit();

const run = await myWorkflow.createRunAsync();

const res = await run.start({
  inputData: { topic: "React JavaScript frameworks" },
});
console.log("Response: ", res);
```

# Giving an Agent a System Prompt
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/agents/system-prompt

When building AI agents, you often need to give them specific instructions and capabilities to handle specialized tasks effectively. System prompts allow you to define an agent's personality, knowledge domain, and behavioral guidelines. This example shows how to create an AI agent with custom instructions and integrate it with a dedicated tool for retrieving verified information.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";

import { z } from "zod";

const instructions = `You are a helpful cat expert assistant. When discussing cats, you should always include an interesting cat fact.

  Your main responsibilities:
  1. Answer questions about cats
  2. Use the catFact tool to provide verified cat facts
  3. Incorporate the cat facts naturally into your responses

  Always use the catFact tool at least once in your responses to ensure accuracy.`;

const getCatFact = async () => {
  const { fact } = (await fetch("https://catfact.ninja/fact").then((res) =>
    res.json(),
  )) as {
    fact: string;
  };

  return fact;
};

const catFact = createTool({
  id: "Get cat facts",
  inputSchema: z.object({}),
  description: "Fetches cat facts",
  execute: async () => {
    console.log("using tool to fetch cat fact");
    return {
      catFact: await getCatFact(),
    };
  },
});

const catOne = new Agent({
  name: "cat-one",
  instructions: instructions,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    catFact,
  },
});

const result = await catOne.generate("Tell me a cat fact");

console.log(result.text);

# Workflow as Tools
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/agents/workflow-as-tools

When building AI applications, you often need to coordinate multiple steps that depend on each other's outputs. This example shows how to create an AI workflow that fetches weather data from a workflow. It also demonstrates how to handle suspend and resume of workflows from an agent.

### Workflow Definition

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createStep, createWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { createTool } from '@mastra/core/tools';
import { z } from "zod";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const forecastSchema = z.object({
  date: z.string(),
  maxTemp: z.number(),
  minTemp: z.number(),
  precipitationChance: z.number(),
  condition: z.string(),
  location: z.string(),
});

function getWeatherCondition(code: number): string {
  const conditions: Record<number, string> = {
    0: 'Clear sky',
    1: 'Mainly clear',
    2: 'Partly cloudy',
    3: 'Overcast',
    45: 'Foggy',
    48: 'Depositing rime fog',
    51: 'Light drizzle',
    53: 'Moderate drizzle',
    55: 'Dense drizzle',
    61: 'Slight rain',
    63: 'Moderate rain',
    65: 'Heavy rain',
    71: 'Slight snow fall',
    73: 'Moderate snow fall',
    75: 'Heavy snow fall',
    95: 'Thunderstorm',
  };
  return conditions[code] || 'Unknown';
}

const fetchWeatherWithSuspend = createStep({
  id: 'fetch-weather',
  description: 'Fetches weather forecast for a given city',
  inputSchema: z.object({}),
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe('The city to get the weather for'),
  }),
  outputSchema: forecastSchema,
  execute: async ({ resumeData, suspend }) => {
    if (!resumeData) {
      suspend({
        message: 'Please enter the city to get the weather for',
      });

      return {};
    }

    const geocodingUrl = `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${encodeURIComponent(resumeData.city)}&count=1`;
    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(geocodingUrl);
    const geocodingData = (await geocodingResponse.json()) as {
      results: { latitude: number; longitude: number; name: string }[];
    };

    if (!geocodingData.results?.[0]) {
      throw new Error(`Location '${resumeData.city}' not found`);
    }

    const { latitude, longitude, name } = geocodingData.results[0];

    const weatherUrl = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=precipitation,weathercode&timezone=auto,&hourly=precipitation_probability,temperature_2m`;
    const response = await fetch(weatherUrl);
    const data = (await response.json()) as {
      current: {
        time: string;
        precipitation: number;
        weathercode: number;
      };
      hourly: {
        precipitation_probability: number[];
        temperature_2m: number[];
      };
    };

    const forecast = {
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      maxTemp: Math.max(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      minTemp: Math.min(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      condition: getWeatherCondition(data.current.weathercode),
      precipitationChance: data.hourly.precipitation_probability.reduce((acc, curr) => Math.max(acc, curr), 0),
      location: resumeData.city,
    };

    return forecast;
  },
});

const weatherWorkflowWithSuspend = createWorkflow({
  id: 'weather-workflow-with-suspend',
  inputSchema: z.object({}),
  outputSchema: forecastSchema,
})
  .then(fetchWeatherWithSuspend)
  .commit();
```

### Tool Definitions

```ts
export const startWeatherTool = createTool({
  id: 'start-weather-tool',
  description: 'Start the weather tool',
  inputSchema: z.object({}),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    runId: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow('weatherWorkflowWithSuspend');
    const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();
    await run.start({
      inputData: {},
    });

    return {
      runId: run.runId,
    };
  },
});

export const resumeWeatherTool = createTool({
  id: 'resume-weather-tool',
  description: 'Resume the weather tool',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    runId: z.string(),
    city: z.string().describe('City name'),
  }),
  outputSchema: forecastSchema,
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow('weatherWorkflowWithSuspend');
    const run = await workflow.createRunAsync({
      runId: context.runId,
    });
    const result = await run.resume({
      step: 'fetch-weather',
      resumeData: {
        city: context.city,
      },
    });
    return result.result;
  },
});
```

### Agent Definition

```ts
export const weatherAgentWithWorkflow = new Agent({
  name: 'Weather Agent with Workflow',
  instructions: `You are a helpful weather assistant that provides accurate weather information.

Your primary function is to help users get weather details for specific locations. When responding:
- Always ask for a location if none is provided
- If the location name isn’t in English, please translate it
- If giving a location with multiple parts (e.g. "New York, NY"), use the most relevant part (e.g. "New York")
- Include relevant details like humidity, wind conditions, and precipitation
- Keep responses concise but informative

Use the startWeatherTool to start the weather workflow. This will start and then suspend the workflow and return a runId.
Use the resumeWeatherTool to resume the weather workflow. This takes the runId returned from the startWeatherTool and the city entered by the user. It will resume the workflow and return the result.
The result will be the weather forecast for the city.`,
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  tools: { startWeatherTool, resumeWeatherTool },
});
```

### Agent Execution
```ts
const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgentWithWorkflow },
  workflows: { weatherWorkflowWithSuspend },
});

const agent = mastra.getAgent('weatherAgentWithWorkflow');
const result = await agent.generate([
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: 'London',
  },
]);

console.log(result);
```

title: "Example: Metadata Extraction | Retrieval | RAG | Mastra Docs"
description: Example of extracting and utilizing metadata from documents in Mastra for enhanced document processing and retrieval.

import { GithubLink } from "@/components/github-link";

# Metadata Extraction
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/embedding/metadata-extraction

This example demonstrates how to extract and utilize metadata from documents using Mastra's document processing capabilities.
The extracted metadata can be used for document organization, filtering, and enhanced retrieval in RAG systems.

## Overview

The system demonstrates metadata extraction in two ways:

1. Direct metadata extraction from a document
2. Chunking with metadata extraction

## Setup

### Dependencies

Import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";
```

## Document Creation

Create a document from text content:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{3} filename="src/index.ts"
const doc = MDocument.fromText(`Title: The Benefits of Regular Exercise

Regular exercise has numerous health benefits. It improves cardiovascular health, 
strengthens muscles, and boosts mental wellbeing.

Key Benefits:
• Reduces stress and anxiety
• Improves sleep quality
• Helps maintain healthy weight
• Increases energy levels

For optimal results, experts recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise 
per week.`);
```

## 1. Direct Metadata Extraction

Extract metadata directly from the document:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{17} filename="src/index.ts"
// Configure metadata extraction options
await doc.extractMetadata({
  keywords: true, // Extract important keywords
  summary: true, // Generate a concise summary
});

// Retrieve the extracted metadata
const meta = doc.getMetadata();
console.log("Extracted Metadata:", meta);

// Example Output:
// Extracted Metadata: {
//   keywords: [
//     'exercise',
//     'health benefits',
//     'cardiovascular health',
//     'mental wellbeing',
//     'stress reduction',
//     'sleep quality'
//   ],
//   summary: 'Regular exercise provides multiple health benefits including improved cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and mental wellbeing. Key benefits include stress reduction, better sleep, weight management, and increased energy. Recommended exercise duration is 150 minutes per week.'
// }
```

## 2. Chunking with Metadata

Combine document chunking with metadata extraction:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{40} filename="src/index.ts"
// Configure chunking with metadata extraction
await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive", // Use recursive chunking strategy
  size: 200, // Maximum chunk size
  extract: {
    keywords: true, // Extract keywords per chunk
    summary: true, // Generate summary per chunk
  },
});

// Get metadata from chunks
const metaTwo = doc.getMetadata();
console.log("Chunk Metadata:", metaTwo);

// Example Output:
// Chunk Metadata: {
//   keywords: [
//     'exercise',
//     'health benefits',
//     'cardiovascular health',
//     'mental wellbeing',
//     'stress reduction',
//     'sleep quality'
//   ],
//   summary: 'Regular exercise provides multiple health benefits including improved cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and mental wellbeing. Key benefits include stress reduction, better sleep, weight management, and increased energy. Recommended exercise duration is 150 minutes per week.'
// }
```

title: "Example: Hybrid Vector Search | RAG | Mastra Docs"
description: Example of using metadata filters with PGVector to enhance vector search results in Mastra.
---

import { GithubLink } from "@/components/github-link";

# Hybrid Vector Search
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/query/hybrid-vector-search

When you combine vector similarity search with metadata filters, you can create a hybrid search that is more precise and efficient.
This approach combines:

- Vector similarity search to find the most relevant documents
- Metadata filters to refine the search results based on additional criteria

This example demonstrates how to use hybrid vector search with Mastra and PGVector.

## Overview

The system implements filtered vector search using Mastra and PGVector. Here's what it does:

1. Queries existing embeddings in PGVector with metadata filters
2. Shows how to filter by different metadata fields
3. Demonstrates combining vector similarity with metadata filtering

> **Note**: For examples of how to extract metadata from your documents, see the [Metadata Extraction](../embedding/metadata-extraction.mdx) guide.
>
> To learn how to create and store embeddings, see the [Upsert Embeddings](/examples/rag/upsert/upsert-embeddings) guide.

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
import { embed } from "ai";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
```

## Vector Store Initialization

Initialize PgVector with your connection string:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{4} filename="src/index.ts"
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});
```

## Example Usage

### Filter by Metadata Value

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{6} filename="src/index.ts"
// Create embedding for the query
const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  value: "[Insert query based on document here]",
});

// Query with metadata filter
const result = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: embedding,

# Retrieving Top-K Results
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/query/retrieve-results

After storing embeddings in a vector database, you need to query them to find similar content.

The `query` method returns the most semantically similar chunks to your input embedding, ranked by relevance. The `topK` parameter allows you to specify the number of results to return.

This example shows how to retrieve similar chunks from a Pinecone vector database.

```tsx copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { PineconeVector } from "@mastra/pinecone";
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";
import { embedMany } from "ai";

const doc = MDocument.fromText("Your text content...");

const chunks = await doc.chunk();

const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});

const pinecone = new PineconeVector({
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
});

await pinecone.createIndex({
  indexName: "test_index",
  dimension: 1536,
});

await pinecone.upsert({
  indexName: "test_index",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks?.map((chunk: any) => ({ text: chunk.text })),
});

const topK = 10;

const results = await pinecone.query({
  indexName: "test_index",
  queryVector: embeddings[0],
  topK,
});

console.log(results);
```

# Re-ranking Results with Tools
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/rerank/rerank-rag

This example demonstrates how to use Mastra's vector query tool to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with re-ranking using OpenAI embeddings and PGVector for vector storage.

## Overview

The system implements RAG with re-ranking using Mastra and OpenAI. Here's what it does:

1. Sets up a Mastra agent with gpt-4o-mini for response generation
2. Creates a vector query tool with re-ranking capabilities
3. Chunks text documents into smaller segments and creates embeddings from them
4. Stores them in a PostgreSQL vector database
5. Retrieves and re-ranks relevant chunks based on queries
6. Generates context-aware responses using the Mastra agent

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Then, import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="index.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
import { 
  MDocument, 
  createVectorQueryTool,
  MastraAgentRelevanceScorer,
} from "@mastra/rag";
import { embedMany } from "ai";
```

## Vector Query Tool Creation with Re-ranking

Using createVectorQueryTool imported from @mastra/rag, you can create a tool that can query the vector database and re-rank results:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{8} filename="index.ts"
const vectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "embeddings",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  reranker: {
    model: new MastraAgentRelevanceScorer('relevance-scorer', openai("gpt-4o-mini")),
  },
});
```

## Agent Configuration

Set up the Mastra agent that will handle the responses:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{17} filename="index.ts"
export const ragAgent = new Agent({
  name: "RAG Agent",
  instructions: `You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context. Keep your answers concise and relevant.
    Important: When asked to answer a question, please base your answer only on the context provided in the tool. 
    If the context doesn't contain enough information to fully answer the question, please state that explicitly.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    vectorQueryTool,
  },
});
```

## Instantiate PgVector and Mastra

Instantiate PgVector and Mastra with the components:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{29} filename="index.ts"
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { ragAgent },
  vectors: { pgVector },
});

const agent = mastra.getAgent("ragAgent");
```

## Document Processing

Create a document and process it into chunks:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{38} filename="index.ts"
const doc1 = MDocument.fromText(`
market data shows price resistance levels.
technical charts display moving averages.
support levels guide trading decisions.
breakout patterns signal entry points.
price action determines trade timing.

baseball cards show gradual value increase.
rookie cards command premium prices.
card condition affects resale value.
authentication prevents fake trading.
grading services verify card quality.

volume analysis confirms price trends.
sports cards track seasonal demand.
chart patterns predict movements.
mint condition doubles card worth.
resistance breaks trigger orders.
rare cards appreciate yearly.
`);

const chunks = await doc1.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 150,
  overlap: 20,
  separator: "\n",
});
```

## Creating and Storing Embeddings

Generate embeddings for the chunks and store them in the vector database:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{66} filename="index.ts"
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});

const vectorStore = mastra.getVector("pgVector");
await vectorStore.createIndex({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  dimension: 1536,
});

await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks?.map((chunk: any) => ({ text: chunk.text })),
});
```

## Querying with Re-ranking

Try different queries to see how the re-ranking affects results:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{82} filename="index.ts"
const queryOne = "explain technical trading analysis";
const answerOne = await agent.generate(queryOne);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryOne);
console.log("Response:", answerOne.text);

const queryTwo = "explain trading card valuation";
const answerTwo = await agent.generate(queryTwo);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryTwo);
console.log("Response:", answerTwo.text);

const queryThree = "how do you analyze market resistance";
const answerThree = await agent.generate(queryThree);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryThree);
console.log("Response:", answerThree.text);
```

# Re-ranking Results
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/rerank/rerank

This example demonstrates how to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with re-ranking using Mastra, OpenAI embeddings, and PGVector for vector storage.

## Overview

The system implements RAG with re-ranking using Mastra and OpenAI. Here's what it does:

1. Chunks text documents into smaller segments and creates embeddings from them
2. Stores vectors in a PostgreSQL database
3. Performs initial vector similarity search
4. Re-ranks results using Mastra's rerank function, combining vector similarity, semantic relevance, and position scores
5. Compares initial and re-ranked results to show improvements

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Then, import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
import { 
  MDocument, 
  rerankWithScorer as rerank, 
  MastraAgentRelevanceScorer 
} from "@mastra/rag";
import { embedMany, embed } from "ai";
```

## Document Processing

Create a document and process it into chunks:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{7} filename="src/index.ts"
const doc1 = MDocument.fromText(`
market data shows price resistance levels.
technical charts display moving averages.
support levels guide trading decisions.
breakout patterns signal entry points.
price action determines trade timing.
`);

const chunks = await doc1.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 150,
  overlap: 20,
  separator: "\n",
});
```

## Creating and Storing Embeddings

Generate embeddings for the chunks and store them in the vector database:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{36} filename="src/index.ts"
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});

const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

await pgVector.createIndex({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  dimension: 1536,
});

await pgVector.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks?.map((chunk: any) => ({ text: chunk.text })),
});
```

## Vector Search and Re-ranking

Perform vector search and re-rank the results:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{51} filename="src/index.ts"
const query = "explain technical trading analysis";

// Get query embedding
const { embedding: queryEmbedding } = await embed({
  value: query,
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});

// Get initial results
const initialResults = await pgVector.query({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  queryVector: queryEmbedding,
  topK: 3,
});

// Re-rank results
const rerankedResults = await rerank({
  results: initialResults,
  query,
  scorer: new MastraAgentRelevanceScorer('relevance-scorer', openai("gpt-4o-mini")),
  options: {
    weights: {
      semantic: 0.5, // How well the content matches the query semantically
      vector: 0.3, // Original vector similarity score
      position: 0.2, // Preserves original result ordering
    },
    topK: 3,
  },
});
```

The weights control how different factors influence the final ranking:

- `semantic`: Higher values prioritize semantic understanding and relevance to the query
- `vector`: Higher values favor the original vector similarity scores
- `position`: Higher values help maintain the original ordering of results

## Comparing Results

Print both initial and re-ranked results to see the improvement:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{72} filename="src/index.ts"
console.log("Initial Results:");
initialResults.forEach((result, index) => {
  console.log(`Result ${index + 1}:`, {
    text: result.metadata.text,
    score: result.score,
  });
});

console.log("Re-ranked Results:");
rerankedResults.forEach(({ result, score, details }, index) => {
  console.log(`Result ${index + 1}:`, {
    text: result.metadata.text,
    score: score,
    semantic: details.semantic,
    vector: details.vector,
    position: details.position,
  });
});
```

The re-ranked results show how combining vector similarity with semantic understanding can improve retrieval quality. Each result includes:

- Overall score combining all factors
- Semantic relevance score from the language model
- Vector similarity score from the embedding comparison
- Position-based score for maintaining original order when appropriate

# Reranking with Cohere
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/rerank/reranking-with-cohere

When retrieving documents for RAG, initial vector similarity search may miss important semantic matches.

Cohere's reranking service helps improve result relevance by reordering documents using multiple scoring factors.

```typescript
import { 
  rerankWithScorer as rerank, 
  CohereRelevanceScorer 
} from "@mastra/rag";

const results = rerank({
  results: searchResults,
  query: "deployment configuration",
  scorer: new CohereRelevanceScorer('rerank-v3.5'),
  {
    topK: 5,
    weights: {
      semantic: 0.4,
      vector: 0.4,
      position: 0.2,
    },
  },
);
```

# Using the Vector Query Tool
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/usage/basic-rag

This example demonstrates how to implement and use `createVectorQueryTool` for semantic search in a RAG system. It shows how to configure the tool, manage vector storage, and retrieve relevant context effectively.

## Overview

The system implements RAG using Mastra and OpenAI. Here's what it does:

1. Sets up a Mastra agent with gpt-4o-mini for response generation
2. Creates a vector query tool to manage vector store interactions
3. Uses existing embeddings to retrieve relevant context
4. Generates context-aware responses using the Mastra agent

> **Note**: To learn how to create and store embeddings, see the [Upsert Embeddings](/examples/rag/upsert/upsert-embeddings) guide.

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createVectorQueryTool } from "@mastra/rag";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
```

## Vector Query Tool Creation

Create a tool that can query the vector database:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{7} filename="src/index.ts"
const vectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "embeddings",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});
```

## Agent Configuration

Set up the Mastra agent that will handle the responses:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{13} filename="src/index.ts"
export const ragAgent = new Agent({
  name: "RAG Agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context. Keep your answers concise and relevant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    vectorQueryTool,
  },
});
```

## Instantiate PgVector and Mastra

Instantiate PgVector and Mastra with all components:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{23} filename="src/index.ts"
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { ragAgent },
  vectors: { pgVector },
});

const agent = mastra.getAgent("ragAgent");
```

## Example Usage

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{32} filename="src/index.ts"
const prompt = `
[Insert query based on document here]
Please base your answer only on the context provided in the tool. 
If the context doesn't contain enough information to fully answer the question, please state that explicitly.
`;

const completion = await agent.generate(prompt);
console.log(completion.text);

# Optimizing Information Density
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/usage/cleanup-rag

This example demonstrates how to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Mastra, OpenAI embeddings, and PGVector for vector storage.
The system uses an agent to clean the initial chunks to optimize information density and deduplicate data.

## Overview

The system implements RAG using Mastra and OpenAI, this time optimizing information density through LLM-based processing. Here's what it does:

1. Sets up a Mastra agent with gpt-4o-mini that can handle both querying and cleaning documents
2. Creates vector query and document chunking tools for the agent to use
3. Processes the initial document:
   - Chunks text documents into smaller segments
   - Creates embeddings for the chunks
   - Stores them in a PostgreSQL vector database
4. Performs an initial query to establish baseline response quality
5. Optimizes the data:
   - Uses the agent to clean and deduplicate chunks
   - Creates new embeddings for the cleaned chunks
   - Updates the vector store with optimized data
6. Performs the same query again to demonstrate improved response quality

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Then, import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="index.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
import {
  MDocument,
  createVectorQueryTool,
  createDocumentChunkerTool,
} from "@mastra/rag";
import { embedMany } from "ai";
```

## Tool Creation

### Vector Query Tool

Using createVectorQueryTool imported from @mastra/rag, you can create a tool that can query the vector database.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{8} filename="index.ts"
const vectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "embeddings",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});
```

### Document Chunker Tool

Using createDocumentChunkerTool imported from @mastra/rag, you can create a tool that chunks the document and sends the chunks to your agent.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{14} filename="index.ts"
const doc = MDocument.fromText(yourText);

const documentChunkerTool = createDocumentChunkerTool({
  doc,
  params: {
    strategy: "recursive",
    size: 512,
    overlap: 25,
    separator: "\n",
  },
});
```

## Agent Configuration

Set up a single Mastra agent that can handle both querying and cleaning:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{26} filename="index.ts"
const ragAgent = new Agent({
  name: "RAG Agent",
  instructions: `You are a helpful assistant that handles both querying and cleaning documents.
    When cleaning: Process, clean, and label data, remove irrelevant information and deduplicate content while preserving key facts.
    When querying: Provide answers based on the available context. Keep your answers concise and relevant.
    
    Important: When asked to answer a question, please base your answer only on the context provided in the tool. If the context doesn't contain enough information to fully answer the question, please state that explicitly.
    `,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    vectorQueryTool,
    documentChunkerTool,
  },
});
```

## Instantiate PgVector and Mastra

Instantiate PgVector and Mastra with the components:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{41} filename="index.ts"
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { ragAgent },
  vectors: { pgVector },
});
const agent = mastra.getAgent("ragAgent");
```

## Document Processing

Chunk the initial document and create embeddings:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{49} filename="index.ts"
const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 256,
  overlap: 50,
  separator: "\n",
});

const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});

const vectorStore = mastra.getVector("pgVector");
await vectorStore.createIndex({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  dimension: 1536,
});

await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks?.map((chunk: any) => ({ text: chunk.text })),
});
```

## Initial Query

Let's try querying the raw data to establish a baseline:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{73} filename="index.ts"
// Generate response using the original embeddings
const query = "What are all the technologies mentioned for space exploration?";
const originalResponse = await agent.generate(query);
console.log("\nQuery:", query);
console.log("Response:", originalResponse.text);
```

## Data Optimization

After seeing the initial results, we can clean the data to improve quality:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{79} filename="index.ts"
const chunkPrompt = `Use the tool provided to clean the chunks. Make sure to filter out irrelevant information that is not space related and remove duplicates.`;

const newChunks = await agent.generate(chunkPrompt);
const updatedDoc = MDocument.fromText(newChunks.text);

const updatedChunks = await updatedDoc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 256,
  overlap: 50,
  separator: "\n",
});

const { embeddings: cleanedEmbeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: updatedChunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});

// Update the vector store with cleaned embeddings
await vectorStore.deleteIndex({ indexName: "embeddings" });
await vectorStore.createIndex({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  dimension: 1536,
});

await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: cleanedEmbeddings,
  metadata: updatedChunks?.map((chunk: any) => ({ text: chunk.text })),
});
```

## Optimized Query

Query the data again after cleaning to observe any differences in the response:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{109} filename="index.ts"
// Query again with cleaned embeddings
const cleanedResponse = await agent.generate(query);
console.log("\nQuery:", query);
console.log("Response:", cleanedResponse.text);
```

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Then, import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="index.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{14} filename="index.ts"
export const ragAgent = new Agent({
  name: "RAG Agent",
  instructions: `You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context.
Follow these steps for each response:

1. First, carefully analyze the retrieved context chunks and identify key information.
2. Break down your thinking process about how the retrieved information relates to the query.
3. Explain how you're connecting different pieces from the retrieved chunks.
4. Draw conclusions based only on the evidence in the retrieved context.
5. If the retrieved chunks don't contain enough information, explicitly state what's missing.

THOUGHT PROCESS:
- Step 1: [Initial analysis of retrieved chunks]
- Step 2: [Connections between chunks]
- Step 3: [Reasoning based on chunks]

FINAL ANSWER:
[Your concise answer based on the retrieved context]

Important: When asked to answer a question, please base your answer only on the context provided in the tool. 
If the context doesn't contain enough information to fully answer the question, please state that explicitly.
Remember: Explain how you're using the retrieved information to reach your conclusions.
`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: { vectorQueryTool },
});
```

# Structured Reasoning with Workflows
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/usage/cot-workflow-rag

This example demonstrates how to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Mastra, OpenAI embeddings, and PGVector for vector storage, with an emphasis on structured reasoning through a defined workflow.

## Overview

The system implements RAG using Mastra and OpenAI with chain-of-thought prompting through a defined workflow. Here's what it does:

1. Sets up a Mastra agent with gpt-4o-mini for response generation
2. Creates a vector query tool to manage vector store interactions
3. Defines a workflow with multiple steps for chain-of-thought reasoning
4. Processes and chunks text documents
5. Creates and stores embeddings in PostgreSQL
6. Generates responses through the workflow steps

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="index.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Step, Workflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
import { createVectorQueryTool, MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";
import { embedMany } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";
```

## Workflow Definition

First, define the workflow with its trigger schema:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{10} filename="index.ts"
export const ragWorkflow = new Workflow({
  name: "rag-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    query: z.string(),
  }),
});
```

## Vector Query Tool Creation

Create a tool for querying the vector database:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{17} filename="index.ts"
const vectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "embeddings",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});
```

## Agent Configuration

Set up the Mastra agent:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{23} filename="index.ts"
export const ragAgent = new Agent({
  name: "RAG Agent",
  instructions: `You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    vectorQueryTool,
  },
});
```

## Workflow Steps

The workflow is divided into multiple steps for chain-of-thought reasoning:

### 1. Context Analysis Step

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{32} filename="index.ts"
const analyzeContext = new Step({
  id: "analyzeContext",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    initialAnalysis: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    console.log("---------------------------");
    const ragAgent = mastra?.getAgent("ragAgent");
    const query = context?.getStepResult<{ query: string }>("trigger")?.query;

    const analysisPrompt = `${query} 1. First, carefully analyze the retrieved context chunks and identify key information.`;

    const analysis = await ragAgent?.generate(analysisPrompt);
    console.log(analysis?.text);
    return {
      initialAnalysis: analysis?.text ?? "",
    };
  },
});
```

### 2. Thought Breakdown Step

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{54} filename="index.ts"
const breakdownThoughts = new Step({
  id: "breakdownThoughts",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    breakdown: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    console.log("---------------------------");
    const ragAgent = mastra?.getAgent("ragAgent");
    const analysis = context?.getStepResult<{
      initialAnalysis: string;
    }>("analyzeContext")?.initialAnalysis;

    const connectionPrompt = `
      Based on the initial analysis: ${analysis}

      2. Break down your thinking process about how the retrieved information relates to the query.
    `;

    const connectionAnalysis = await ragAgent?.generate(connectionPrompt);
    console.log(connectionAnalysis?.text);
    return {
      breakdown: connectionAnalysis?.text ?? "",
    };
  },
});
```

### 3. Connection Step

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{80} filename="index.ts"
const connectPieces = new Step({
  id: "connectPieces",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    connections: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    console.log("---------------------------");
    const ragAgent = mastra?.getAgent("ragAgent");
    const process = context?.getStepResult<{
      breakdown: string;
    }>("breakdownThoughts")?.breakdown;
    const connectionPrompt = `
        Based on the breakdown: ${process}

        3. Explain how you're connecting different pieces from the retrieved chunks.
    `;

    const connections = await ragAgent?.generate(connectionPrompt);
    console.log(connections?.text);
    return {
      connections: connections?.text ?? "",
    };
  },
});
```

### 4. Conclusion Step

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{105} filename="index.ts"
const drawConclusions = new Step({
  id: "drawConclusions",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    conclusions: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    console.log("---------------------------");
    const ragAgent = mastra?.getAgent("ragAgent");
    const evidence = context?.getStepResult<{
      connections: string;
    }>("connectPieces")?.connections;
    const conclusionPrompt = `
        Based on the connections: ${evidence}

        4. Draw conclusions based only on the evidence in the retrieved context.
    `;

    const conclusions = await ragAgent?.generate(conclusionPrompt);
    console.log(conclusions?.text);
    return {
      conclusions: conclusions?.text ?? "",
    };
  },
});
```

### 5. Final Answer Step

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{130} filename="index.ts"
const finalAnswer = new Step({
  id: "finalAnswer",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    finalAnswer: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, mastra }) => {
    console.log("---------------------------");
    const ragAgent = mastra?.getAgent("ragAgent");
    const conclusions = context?.getStepResult<{
      conclusions: string;
    }>("drawConclusions")?.conclusions;
    const answerPrompt = `
        Based on the conclusions: ${conclusions}
        Format your response as:
        THOUGHT PROCESS:
        - Step 1: [Initial analysis of retrieved chunks]
        - Step 2: [Connections between chunks]
        - Step 3: [Reasoning based on chunks]

        FINAL ANSWER:
        [Your concise answer based on the retrieved context]`;

    const finalAnswer = await ragAgent?.generate(answerPrompt);
    console.log(finalAnswer?.text);
    return {
      finalAnswer: finalAnswer?.text ?? "",
    };
  },
});
```

## Workflow Configuration

Connect all the steps in the workflow:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{160} filename="index.ts"
ragWorkflow
  .step(analyzeContext)
  .then(breakdownThoughts)
  .then(connectPieces)
  .then(drawConclusions)
  .then(finalAnswer);

ragWorkflow.commit();
```

## Instantiate PgVector and Mastra

Instantiate PgVector and Mastra with all components:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{169} filename="index.ts"
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { ragAgent },
  vectors: { pgVector },
  workflows: { ragWorkflow },
});
```

## Document Processing

Process and chunks the document:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{177} filename="index.ts"
const doc = MDocument.fromText(
  `The Impact of Climate Change on Global Agriculture...`,
);

const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 512,
  overlap: 50,
  separator: "\n",
});
```

## Embedding Creation and Storage

Generate and store embeddings:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{186} filename="index.ts"
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});

const vectorStore = mastra.getVector("pgVector");
await vectorStore.createIndex({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  dimension: 1536,
});
await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks?.map((chunk: any) => ({ text: chunk.text })),
});
```

## Workflow Execution

Here's how to execute the workflow with a query:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{202} filename="index.ts"
const query = "What are the main adaptation strategies for farmers?";

console.log("\nQuery:", query);
const prompt = `
    Please answer the following question:
    ${query}

    Please base your answer only on the context provided in the tool. If the context doesn't contain enough information to fully answer the question, please state that explicitly.
    `;

const { runId, start } = await ragWorkflow.createRunAsync();

console.log("Run:", runId);

const workflowResult = await start({
  triggerData: {
    query: prompt,
  },
});
console.log("\nThought Process:");
console.log(workflowResult.results);
```

# Database-Specific Configurations
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/usage/database-specific-config

This example demonstrates how to use database-specific configurations with vector query tools to optimize performance and leverage unique features of different vector stores.

## Multi-Environment Setup

Use different configurations for different environments:

<Tabs items={['TypeScript', 'JavaScript']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript
    import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
    import { createVectorQueryTool } from "@mastra/rag";
    import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/runtime-context";

    // Base configuration
    const createSearchTool = (environment: 'dev' | 'staging' | 'prod') => {
      return createVectorQueryTool({
        vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
        indexName: "documents",
        model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
        databaseConfig: {
          pinecone: {
            namespace: environment
          }
        }
      });
    };

    // Create environment-specific tools
    const devSearchTool = createSearchTool('dev');
    const prodSearchTool = createSearchTool('prod');

    // Or use runtime override
    const dynamicSearchTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "pinecone", 
      indexName: "documents",
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small")
    });

    // Switch environment at runtime
    const switchEnvironment = async (environment: string, query: string) => {
      const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
      runtimeContext.set('databaseConfig', {
        pinecone: {
          namespace: environment
        }
      });

      return await dynamicSearchTool.execute({
        context: { queryText: query },
        mastra,
        runtimeContext
      });
    };
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```javascript
    import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
    import { createVectorQueryTool } from "@mastra/rag";
    import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/runtime-context";

    // Base configuration
    const createSearchTool = (environment) => {
      return createVectorQueryTool({
        vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
        indexName: "documents", 
        model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
        databaseConfig: {
          pinecone: {
            namespace: environment
          }
        }
      });
    };

    // Create environment-specific tools
    const devSearchTool = createSearchTool('dev');
    const prodSearchTool = createSearchTool('prod');

    // Or use runtime override
    const dynamicSearchTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
      indexName: "documents",
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small")
    });

    // Switch environment at runtime
    const switchEnvironment = async (environment, query) => {
      const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
      runtimeContext.set('databaseConfig', {
        pinecone: {
          namespace: environment
        }
      });

      return await dynamicSearchTool.execute({
        context: { queryText: query },
        mastra,
        runtimeContext
      });
    };
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

## Performance Optimization with pgVector

Optimize search performance for different use cases:

<Tabs items={['High Accuracy', 'High Speed', 'Balanced']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript
    // High accuracy configuration - slower but more precise
    const highAccuracyTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "postgres",
      indexName: "embeddings",
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
      databaseConfig: {
        pgvector: {
          ef: 400,          // High accuracy for HNSW
          probes: 20,       // High recall for IVFFlat
          minScore: 0.85    // High quality threshold
        }
      }
    });

    // Use for critical searches where accuracy is paramount
    const criticalSearch = async (query: string) => {
      return await highAccuracyTool.execute({
        context: { 
          queryText: query,
          topK: 5  // Fewer, higher quality results
        },
        mastra
      });
    };
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript
    // High speed configuration - faster but less precise
    const highSpeedTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "postgres", 
      indexName: "embeddings",
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
      databaseConfig: {
        pgvector: {
          ef: 50,           // Lower accuracy for speed
          probes: 3,        // Lower recall for speed
          minScore: 0.6     // Lower quality threshold
        }
      }
    });

    // Use for real-time applications
    const realtimeSearch = async (query: string) => {
      return await highSpeedTool.execute({
        context: { 
          queryText: query,
          topK: 10  // More results to compensate for lower precision
        },
        mastra
      });
    };
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```typescript
    // Balanced configuration - good compromise
    const balancedTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "postgres",
      indexName: "embeddings", 
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
      databaseConfig: {
        pgvector: {
          ef: 150,          // Moderate accuracy
          probes: 8,        // Moderate recall
          minScore: 0.7     // Moderate quality threshold
        }
      }
    });

    // Adjust parameters based on load
    const adaptiveSearch = async (query: string, isHighLoad: boolean) => {
      const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
      
      if (isHighLoad) {
        // Reduce quality for speed during high load
        runtimeContext.set('databaseConfig', {
          pgvector: {
            ef: 75,
            probes: 5,
            minScore: 0.65
          }
        });
      }

      return await balancedTool.execute({
        context: { queryText: query },
        mastra,
        runtimeContext
      });
    };
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Multi-Tenant Application with Pinecone

Implement tenant isolation using Pinecone namespaces:

```typescript
interface Tenant {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  namespace: string;
}

class MultiTenantSearchService {
  private searchTool: RagTool

  constructor() {
    this.searchTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
      indexName: "shared-documents",
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small")
    });
  }

  async searchForTenant(tenant: Tenant, query: string) {
    const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
    
    // Isolate search to tenant's namespace
    runtimeContext.set('databaseConfig', {
      pinecone: {
        namespace: tenant.namespace
      }
    });

    const results = await this.searchTool.execute({
      context: { 
        queryText: query,
        topK: 10
      },
      mastra,
      runtimeContext
    });

    // Add tenant context to results
    return {
      tenant: tenant.name,
      query,
      results: results.relevantContext,
      sources: results.sources
    };
  }

  async bulkSearchForTenants(tenants: Tenant[], query: string) {
    const promises = tenants.map(tenant => 
      this.searchForTenant(tenant, query)
    );
    
    return await Promise.all(promises);
  }
}

// Usage
const searchService = new MultiTenantSearchService();

const tenants = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Company A', namespace: 'company-a' },
  { id: '2', name: 'Company B', namespace: 'company-b' }
];

const results = await searchService.searchForTenant(
  tenants[0], 
  "product documentation"
);
```

## Hybrid Search with Pinecone

Combine semantic and keyword search:

```typescript
const hybridSearchTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "documents",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  databaseConfig: {
    pinecone: {
      namespace: "production",
      sparseVector: {
        // Example sparse vector for keyword "API"
        indices: [1, 5, 10, 15],
        values: [0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]
      }
    }
  }
});

// Helper function to generate sparse vectors for keywords
const generateSparseVector = (keywords: string[]) => {
  // This is a simplified example - in practice, you'd use
  // a proper sparse encoding method like BM25
  const indices: number[] = [];
  const values: number[] = [];
  
  keywords.forEach((keyword, i) => {
    const hash = keyword.split('').reduce((a, b) => {
      a = ((a << 5) - a) + b.charCodeAt(0);
      return a & a;
    }, 0);
    
    indices.push(Math.abs(hash) % 1000);
    values.push(1.0 / (i + 1)); // Decrease weight for later keywords
  });
  
  return { indices, values };
};

const hybridSearch = async (query: string, keywords: string[]) => {
  const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
  
  if (keywords.length > 0) {
    const sparseVector = generateSparseVector(keywords);
    runtimeContext.set('databaseConfig', {
      pinecone: {
        namespace: "production",
        sparseVector
      }
    });
  }

  return await hybridSearchTool.execute({
    context: { queryText: query },
    mastra,
    runtimeContext
  });
};

// Usage
const results = await hybridSearch(
  "How to use the REST API",
  ["API", "REST", "documentation"]
);
```

## Quality-Gated Search

Implement progressive search quality:

```typescript
const createQualityGatedSearch = () => {
  const baseConfig = {
    vectorStoreName: "postgres",
    indexName: "embeddings",
    model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small")
  };

  return {
    // High quality search first
    highQuality: createVectorQueryTool({
      ...baseConfig,
      databaseConfig: {
        pgvector: {
          minScore: 0.85,
          ef: 200,
          probes: 15
        }
      }
    }),
    
    // Medium quality fallback
    mediumQuality: createVectorQueryTool({
      ...baseConfig,
      databaseConfig: {
        pgvector: {
          minScore: 0.7,
          ef: 150,
          probes: 10
        }
      }
    }),
    
    // Low quality last resort
    lowQuality: createVectorQueryTool({
      ...baseConfig,
      databaseConfig: {
        pgvector: {
          minScore: 0.5,
          ef: 100,
          probes: 5
        }
      }
    })
  };
};

const progressiveSearch = async (query: string, minResults: number = 3) => {
  const tools = createQualityGatedSearch();
  
  // Try high quality first
  let results = await tools.highQuality.execute({
    context: { queryText: query },
    mastra
  });
  
  if (results.sources.length >= minResults) {
    return { quality: 'high', ...results };
  }
  
  // Fallback to medium quality
  results = await tools.mediumQuality.execute({
    context: { queryText: query },
    mastra
  });
  
  if (results.sources.length >= minResults) {
    return { quality: 'medium', ...results };
  }
  
  // Last resort: low quality
  results = await tools.lowQuality.execute({
    context: { queryText: query },
    mastra
  });
  
  return { quality: 'low', ...results };
};

// Usage
const results = await progressiveSearch("complex technical query", 5);
console.log(`Found ${results.sources.length} results with ${results.quality} quality`);
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Environment Isolation**: Use namespaces to separate data by environment or tenant
2. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust ef/probes parameters based on your accuracy vs speed requirements
3. **Quality Control**: Use minScore to filter out low-quality matches
4. **Runtime Flexibility**: Override configurations dynamically based on context
5. **Progressive Quality**: Implement fallback strategies for different quality levels

This approach allows you to optimize vector search for your specific use case while maintaining flexibility and performance.

# Agent-Driven Metadata Filtering
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/usage/filter-rag

This example demonstrates how to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Mastra, OpenAI embeddings, and PGVector for vector storage.
This system uses an agent to construct metadata filters from a user's query to search for relevant chunks in the vector store, reducing the amount of results returned.

## Overview

The system implements metadata filtering using Mastra and OpenAI. Here's what it does:

1. Sets up a Mastra agent with gpt-4o-mini to understand queries and identify filter requirements
2. Creates a vector query tool to handle metadata filtering and semantic search
3. Processes documents into chunks with metadata and embeddings
4. Stores both vectors and metadata in PGVector for efficient retrieval
5. Processes queries by combining metadata filters with semantic search

When a user asks a question:

- The agent analyzes the query to understand the intent
- Constructs appropriate metadata filters (e.g., by topic, date, category)
- Uses the vector query tool to find the most relevant information
- Generates a contextual response based on the filtered results

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Then, import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="index.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { PgVector, PGVECTOR_PROMPT } from "@mastra/pg";
import { createVectorQueryTool, MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";
import { embedMany } from "ai";
```

## Vector Query Tool Creation

Using createVectorQueryTool imported from @mastra/rag, you can create a tool that enables metadata filtering. Each vector store has its own prompt that defines the supported filter operators and syntax:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{9} filename="index.ts"
const vectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  id: "vectorQueryTool",
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "embeddings",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  enableFilter: true,
});
```

Each prompt includes:

- Supported operators (comparison, array, logical, element)
- Example usage for each operator
- Store-specific restrictions and rules
- Complex query examples

## Document Processing

Create a document and process it into chunks with metadata:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{17} filename="index.ts"
const doc = MDocument.fromText(
  `The Impact of Climate Change on Global Agriculture...`,
);

const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 512,
  overlap: 50,
  separator: "\n",
  extract: {
    keywords: true, // Extracts keywords from each chunk
  },
});
```

### Transform Chunks into Metadata

Transform chunks into metadata that can be filtered:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{31} filename="index.ts"
const chunkMetadata = chunks?.map((chunk: any, index: number) => ({
  text: chunk.text,
  ...chunk.metadata,
  nested: {
    keywords: chunk.metadata.excerptKeywords
      .replace("KEYWORDS:", "")
      .split(",")
      .map((k) => k.trim()),
    id: index,
  },
}));
```

## Agent Configuration

The agent is configured to understand user queries and translate them into appropriate metadata filters.

The agent requires both the vector query tool and a system prompt containing:

- Metadata structure for available filter fields
- Vector store prompt for filter operations and syntax

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{43} filename="index.ts"
export const ragAgent = new Agent({
  name: "RAG Agent",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  instructions: `
  You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context. Keep your answers concise and relevant.

  Filter the context by searching the metadata.
  
  The metadata is structured as follows:

  {
    text: string,
    excerptKeywords: string,
    nested: {
      keywords: string[],
      id: number,
    },
  }

  ${PGVECTOR_PROMPT}

  Important: When asked to answer a question, please base your answer only on the context provided in the tool. 
  If the context doesn't contain enough information to fully answer the question, please state that explicitly.
  `,
  tools: { vectorQueryTool },
});
```

The agent's instructions are designed to:

- Process user queries to identify filter requirements
- Use the metadata structure to find relevant information
- Apply appropriate filters through the vectorQueryTool and the provided vector store prompt
- Generate responses based on the filtered context

> Note: Different vector stores have specific prompts available. See [Vector Store Prompts](/docs/rag/retrieval#vector-store-prompts) for details.

## Instantiate PgVector and Mastra

Instantiate PgVector and Mastra with the components:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{69} filename="index.ts"
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { ragAgent },
  vectors: { pgVector },
});
const agent = mastra.getAgent("ragAgent");
```

## Creating and Storing Embeddings

Generate embeddings and store them with metadata:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{78} filename="index.ts"
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});

const vectorStore = mastra.getVector("pgVector");
await vectorStore.createIndex({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  dimension: 1536,
});

// Store both embeddings and metadata together
await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunkMetadata,
});
```

The `upsert` operation stores both the vector embeddings and their associated metadata, enabling combined semantic search and metadata filtering capabilities.

## Metadata-Based Querying

Try different queries using metadata filters:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{96} filename="index.ts"
const queryOne = "What are the adaptation strategies mentioned?";
const answerOne = await agent.generate(queryOne);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryOne);
console.log("Response:", answerOne.text);

const queryTwo =
  'Show me recent sections. Check the "nested.id" field and return values that are greater than 2.';
const answerTwo = await agent.generate(queryTwo);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryTwo);
console.log("Response:", answerTwo.text);

const queryThree =
  'Search the "text" field using regex operator to find sections containing "temperature".';
const answerThree = await agent.generate(queryThree);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryThree);
console.log("Response:", answerThree.text);

# Graph RAG
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/rag/usage/graph-rag

This example demonstrates how to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Mastra, OpenAI embeddings, and PGVector for vector storage.

## Overview

The system implements Graph RAG using Mastra and OpenAI. Here's what it does:

1. Sets up a Mastra agent with gpt-4o-mini for response generation
2. Creates a GraphRAG tool to manage vector store interactions and knowledge graph creation/traversal
3. Chunks text documents into smaller segments
4. Creates embeddings for these chunks
5. Stores them in a PostgreSQL vector database
6. Creates a knowledge graph of relevant chunks based on queries using GraphRAG tool
   - Tool returns results from vector store and creates knowledge graph
   - Traverses knowledge graph using query
7. Generates context-aware responses using the Mastra agent

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
```

### Dependencies

Then, import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="index.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
import { MDocument, createGraphRAGTool } from "@mastra/rag";
import { embedMany } from "ai";
```

## GraphRAG Tool Creation

Using createGraphRAGTool imported from @mastra/rag, you can create a tool that queries the vector database and converts the results into a knowledge graph:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{8} filename="index.ts"
const graphRagTool = createGraphRAGTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "embeddings",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  graphOptions: {
    dimension: 1536,
    threshold: 0.7,
  },
});
```

## Agent Configuration

Set up the Mastra agent that will handle the responses:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{19} filename="index.ts"
const ragAgent = new Agent({
  name: "GraphRAG Agent",
  instructions: `You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context. Format your answers as follows:

1. DIRECT FACTS: List only the directly stated facts from the text relevant to the question (2-3 bullet points)
2. CONNECTIONS MADE: List the relationships you found between different parts of the text (2-3 bullet points)
3. CONCLUSION: One sentence summary that ties everything together

Keep each section brief and focus on the most important points.

Important: When asked to answer a question, please base your answer only on the context provided in the tool. 
If the context doesn't contain enough information to fully answer the question, please state that explicitly.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    graphRagTool,
  },
});
```

## Instantiate PgVector and Mastra

Instantiate PgVector and Mastra with the components:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{36} filename="index.ts"
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { ragAgent },
  vectors: { pgVector },
});
const agent = mastra.getAgent("ragAgent");
```

## Document Processing

Create a document and process it into chunks:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{45} filename="index.ts"
const doc = MDocument.fromText(`
# Riverdale Heights: Community Development Study
// ... text content ...
`);

const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 512,
  overlap: 50,
  separator: "\n",
});
```

## Creating and Storing Embeddings

Generate embeddings for the chunks and store them in the vector database:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{56} filename="index.ts"
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});

const vectorStore = mastra.getVector("pgVector");
await vectorStore.createIndex({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  dimension: 1536,
});
await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: "embeddings",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks?.map((chunk: any) => ({ text: chunk.text })),
});
```

## Graph-Based Querying

Try different queries to explore relationships in the data:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{82} filename="index.ts"
const queryOne =
  "What are the direct and indirect effects of early railway decisions on Riverdale Heights' current state?";
const answerOne = await ragAgent.generate(queryOne);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryOne);
console.log("Response:", answerOne.text);

const queryTwo =
  "How have changes in transportation infrastructure affected different generations of local businesses and community spaces?";
const answerTwo = await ragAgent.generate(queryTwo);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryTwo);
console.log("Response:", answerTwo.text);

const queryThree =
  "Compare how the Rossi family business and Thompson Steel Works responded to major infrastructure changes, and how their responses affected the community.";
const answerThree = await ragAgent.generate(queryThree);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryThree);
console.log("Response:", answerThree.text);

const queryFour =
  "Trace how the transformation of the Thompson Steel Works site has influenced surrounding businesses and cultural spaces from 1932 to present.";
const answerFour = await ragAgent.generate(queryFour);
console.log("\nQuery:", queryFour);
console.log("Response:", answerFour.text);
```

# Tool/Agent as a Workflow step
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows/agent-and-tool-interop

This example demonstrates how to create and integrate a tool or an agent as a workflow step.
Mastra provides a `createStep` helper function which accepts either a step or agent and returns an object which satisfies the Step interface.

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @mastra/core
```

## Define Weather Reporter Agent

Define a weather reporter agent that leverages an LLM to explain the weather report like a weather reporter.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/weather-reporter-agent.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

// Create an agent that explains weather reports in a conversational style
export const weatherReporterAgent = new Agent({
  name: "weatherExplainerAgent",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  instructions: `
  You are a weather explainer. You have access to input that will help you get weather-specific activities for any city.
  The tool uses agents to plan the activities, you just need to provide the city. Explain the weather report like a weather reporter.
  `,
});
```

## Define Weather Tool

Define a weather tool that take a location name as input and outputs detailed weather information.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="tools/weather-tool.ts"
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

interface GeocodingResponse {
  results: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    name: string;
  }[];
}
interface WeatherResponse {
  current: {
    time: string;
    temperature_2m: number;
    apparent_temperature: number;
    relative_humidity_2m: number;
    wind_speed_10m: number;
    wind_gusts_10m: number;
    weather_code: number;
  };
}

// Create a tool to fetch weather data
export const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "get-weather",
  description: "Get current weather for a location",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("City name"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    temperature: z.number(),
    feelsLike: z.number(),
    humidity: z.number(),
    windSpeed: z.number(),
    windGust: z.number(),
    conditions: z.string(),
    location: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    return await getWeather(context.location);
  },
});

// Helper function to fetch weather data from external APIs
const getWeather = async (location: string) => {
  const geocodingUrl = `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${encodeURIComponent(location)}&count=1`;
  const geocodingResponse = await fetch(geocodingUrl);
  const geocodingData = (await geocodingResponse.json()) as GeocodingResponse;

  if (!geocodingData.results?.[0]) {
    throw new Error(`Location '${location}' not found`);
  }

  const { latitude, longitude, name } = geocodingData.results[0];

  const weatherUrl = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=temperature_2m,apparent_temperature,relative_humidity_2m,wind_speed_10m,wind_gusts_10m,weather_code`;

  const response = await fetch(weatherUrl);
  const data = (await response.json()) as WeatherResponse;

  return {
    temperature: data.current.temperature_2m,
    feelsLike: data.current.apparent_temperature,
    humidity: data.current.relative_humidity_2m,
    windSpeed: data.current.wind_speed_10m,
    windGust: data.current.wind_gusts_10m,
    conditions: getWeatherCondition(data.current.weather_code),
    location: name,
  };
};

// Helper function to convert numeric weather codes to human-readable descriptions
function getWeatherCondition(code: number): string {
  const conditions: Record<number, string> = {
    0: "Clear sky",
    1: "Mainly clear",
    2: "Partly cloudy",
    3: "Overcast",
    45: "Foggy",
    48: "Depositing rime fog",
    51: "Light drizzle",
    53: "Moderate drizzle",
    55: "Dense drizzle",
    56: "Light freezing drizzle",
    57: "Dense freezing drizzle",
    61: "Slight rain",
    63: "Moderate rain",
    65: "Heavy rain",
    66: "Light freezing rain",
    67: "Heavy freezing rain",
    71: "Slight snow fall",
    73: "Moderate snow fall",
    75: "Heavy snow fall",
    77: "Snow grains",
    80: "Slight rain showers",
    81: "Moderate rain showers",
    82: "Violent rain showers",
    85: "Slight snow showers",
    86: "Heavy snow showers",
    95: "Thunderstorm",
    96: "Thunderstorm with slight hail",
    99: "Thunderstorm with heavy hail",
  };
  return conditions[code] || "Unknown";
}
```

## Define Interop Workflow

Defines a workflow which takes an agent and tool as a step.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/interop-workflow.ts"
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { weatherTool } from "../tools/weather-tool";
import { weatherReporterAgent } from "../agents/weather-reporter-agent";
import { z } from "zod";

// Create workflow steps from existing tool and agent
const fetchWeather = createStep(weatherTool);
const reportWeather = createStep(weatherReporterAgent);

const weatherWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  steps: [fetchWeather, reportWeather],
  id: "weather-workflow-step1-single-day",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("The city to get the weather for"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    text: z.string(),
  }),
})
  .then(fetchWeather)
  .then(
    createStep({
      id: "report-weather",
      inputSchema: fetchWeather.outputSchema,
      outputSchema: z.object({
        text: z.string(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
        // Create a prompt with the weather data
        const prompt = "Forecast data: " + JSON.stringify(inputData);
        const agent = mastra.getAgent("weatherReporterAgent");

        // Generate a weather report using the agent
        const result = await agent.generate([
          {
            role: "user",
            content: prompt,
          },
        ]);
        return { text: result.text };
      },
    }),
  );

weatherWorkflow.commit();

export { weatherWorkflow };
```

## Register Workflow instance with Mastra class

Register the workflow with the mastra instance.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { weatherWorkflow } from "./workflows/interop-workflow";
import { weatherReporterAgent } from "./agents/weather-reporter-agent";

// Create a new Mastra instance with our components
const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    weatherWorkflow,
  },
  agents: {
    weatherReporterAgent,
  },
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});

export { mastra };
```

## Execute the workflow

Here, we'll get the weather workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { mastra } from "./";

const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("weatherWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

// Start the workflow with Lagos as the location
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { location: "Lagos" } });
console.dir(result, { depth: null });
```

## Workflows (Legacy)

The following links provide example documentation for legacy workflows:

- [Calling an Agent From a Workflow (Legacy)](/examples/workflows_legacy/calling-agent)
- [Tool as a Workflow step (Legacy)](/examples/workflows_legacy/using-a-tool-as-a-step)

description: Example of using Mastra to process an array using .foreach() in a workflow.
---

# Array as Input
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows/array-as-input

This example demonstrates how to process an array input in a workflow. Mastra provides a `.foreach()` helper function that executes a step for each item in the array.

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @mastra/core simple-git
```

## Define Docs Generator Agent

Define a docs generator agent that leverages an LLM call to generate a documentation given a code file or a summary of a code file.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/docs-generator-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create a documentation generator agent for code analysis
const docGeneratorAgent = new Agent({
  name: "doc_generator_agent",
  instructions: `You are a technical documentation expert. You will analyze the provided code files and generate a comprehensive documentation summary.
            For each file:
            1. Identify the main purpose and functionality
            2. Document key components, classes, functions, and interfaces
            3. Note important dependencies and relationships between components
            4. Highlight any notable patterns or architectural decisions
            5. Include relevant code examples where helpful

            Format the documentation in a clear, organized manner using markdown with:
            - File overviews
            - Component breakdowns
            - Code examples
            - Cross-references between related components

            Focus on making the documentation clear and useful for developers who need to understand and work with this codebase.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
});

export { docGeneratorAgent };
```

## Define File Summary Workflow

Define the file summary workflow with 2 steps: one to fetch the code of a particular file and another to generate a readme for that particular code file.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/file-summary-workflow.ts"
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { docGeneratorAgent } from "../agents/docs-generator-agent";
import { z } from "zod";
import fs from "fs";

// Step 1: Read the code content from a file
const scrapeCodeStep = createStep({
  id: "scrape_code",
  description: "Scrape the code from a single file",
  inputSchema: z.string(),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    path: z.string(),
    content: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const filePath = inputData;
    const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf-8");
    return {
      path: filePath,
      content,
    };
  },
});

// Step 2: Generate documentation for a single file
const generateDocForFileStep = createStep({
  id: "generateDocForFile",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    path: z.string(),
    content: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    path: z.string(),
    documentation: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const docs = await docGeneratorAgent.generate(
      `Generate documentation for the following code: ${inputData.content}`,
    );
    return {
      path: inputData.path,
      documentation: docs.text.toString(),
    };
  },
});

const generateSummaryWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "generate-summary",
  inputSchema: z.string(),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    path: z.string(),
    documentation: z.string(),
  }),
  steps: [scrapeCodeStep, generateDocForFileStep],
})
  .then(scrapeCodeStep)
  .then(generateDocForFileStep)
  .commit();

export { generateSummaryWorkflow };
```

## Define Readme Generator Workflow

Define a readme generator workflow with 4 steps: one to clone the github repository, one to suspend the workflow and get user input on what all folders to consider while generating a readme, one to generate a summary of all the files inside the folder, and another to collate all the documentation generated for each file into a single readme.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/readme-generator-workflow.ts
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { docGeneratorAgent } from "../agents/docs-generator-agent";
import { generateSummaryWorkflow } from "./file-summary-workflow";
import { z } from "zod";
import simpleGit from "simple-git";
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

// Step 1: Clone a GitHub repository locally
const cloneRepositoryStep = createStep({
  id: "clone_repository",
  description: "Clone the repository from the given URL",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    repoUrl: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    success: z.boolean(),
    message: z.string(),
    data: z.object({
      repoUrl: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  execute: async ({
    inputData,
    mastra,
    getStepResult,
    getInitData,
    runtimeContext,
  }) => {
    const git = simpleGit();
    // Skip cloning if repo already exists
    if (fs.existsSync("./temp")) {
      return {
        success: true,
        message: "Repository already exists",
        data: {
          repoUrl: inputData.repoUrl,
        },
      };
    }
    try {
      // Clone the repository to the ./temp directory
      await git.clone(inputData.repoUrl, "./temp");
      return {
        success: true,
        message: "Repository cloned successfully",
        data: {
          repoUrl: inputData.repoUrl,
        },
      };
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to clone repository: ${error}`);
    }
  },
});

// Step 2: Get user input on which folders to analyze
const selectFolderStep = createStep({
  id: "select_folder",
  description: "Select the folder(s) to generate the docs",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    success: z.boolean(),
    message: z.string(),
    data: z.object({
      repoUrl: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.array(z.string()),
  suspendSchema: z.object({
    folders: z.array(z.string()),
    message: z.string(),
  }),
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    selection: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
  execute: async ({ resumeData, suspend }) => {
    const tempPath = "./temp";
    const folders = fs
      .readdirSync(tempPath)
      .filter((item) => fs.statSync(path.join(tempPath, item)).isDirectory());

    if (!resumeData?.selection) {
      await suspend({
        folders,
        message: "Please select folders to generate documentation for:",
      });
      return [];
    }

    // Gather all file paths from selected folders
    const filePaths: string[] = [];
    // Helper function to recursively read files from directories
    const readFilesRecursively = (dir: string) => {
      const items = fs.readdirSync(dir);
      for (const item of items) {
        const fullPath = path.join(dir, item);
        const stat = fs.statSync(fullPath);
        if (stat.isDirectory()) {
          readFilesRecursively(fullPath);
        } else if (stat.isFile()) {
          filePaths.push(fullPath.replace(tempPath + "/", ""));
        }
      }
    };

    for (const folder of resumeData.selection) {
      readFilesRecursively(path.join(tempPath, folder));
    }

    return filePaths;
  },
});

// Step 4: Combine all documentation into a single README
const collateDocumentationStep = createStep({
  id: "collate_documentation",
  inputSchema: z.array(
    z.object({
      path: z.string(),
      documentation: z.string(),
    }),
  ),
  outputSchema: z.string(),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const readme = await docGeneratorAgent.generate(
      `Generate a README.md file for the following documentation: ${inputData.map((doc) => doc.documentation).join("\n")}`,
    );

    return readme.text.toString();
  },
});

const readmeGeneratorWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "readme-generator",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    repoUrl: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    success: z.boolean(),
    message: z.string(),
    data: z.object({
      repoUrl: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  steps: [
    cloneRepositoryStep,
    selectFolderStep,
    generateSummaryWorkflow,
    collateDocumentationStep,
  ],
})
  .then(cloneRepositoryStep)
  .then(selectFolderStep)
  .foreach(generateSummaryWorkflow)
  .then(collateDocumentationStep)
  .commit();

export { readmeGeneratorWorkflow };
```

## Register Agent and Workflow instances with Mastra class

Register the agents and workflow with the mastra instance. This is critical for enabling access to the agents within the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { docGeneratorAgent } from "./agents/docs-generator-agent";
import { readmeGeneratorWorkflow } from "./workflows/readme-generator-workflow";
import { generateSummaryWorkflow } from "./workflows/file-summary-workflow";

// Create a new Mastra instance and register components
const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: {
    docGeneratorAgent,
  },
  workflows: {
    readmeGeneratorWorkflow,
    generateSummaryWorkflow,
  },
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});

export { mastra };
```

## Execute the Readme Generator Workflow

Here, we'll get the reamde generator workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { promptUserForFolders } from "./utils";
import { mastra } from "./";

// GitHub repository to generate documentation for
const ghRepoUrl = "https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra";
const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("readmeGeneratorWorkflow").createRunAsync();

// Start the workflow with the repository URL as input
const res = await run.start({ inputData: { repoUrl: ghRepoUrl } });
const { status, steps } = res;

// Handle suspended workflow (waiting for user input)
if (status === "suspended") {
  // Get the suspended step data
  const suspendedStep = steps["select_folder"];
  let folderList: string[] = [];

  // Extract the folder list from step data
  if (
    suspendedStep.status === "suspended" &&
    "folders" in suspendedStep.payload
  ) {
    folderList = suspendedStep.payload.folders as string[];
  } else if (suspendedStep.status === "success" && suspendedStep.output) {
    folderList = suspendedStep.output;
  }

  if (!folderList.length) {
    console.log("No folders available for selection.");
    process.exit(1);
  }

  // Prompt user to select folders
  const folders = await promptUserForFolders(folderList);

  // Resume the workflow with user selections
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    resumeData: { selection: folders },
    step: "select_folder",
  });

  // Print resumed result
  if (resumedResult.status === "success") {
    console.log(resumedResult.result);
  } else {
    console.log(resumedResult);
  }
  process.exit(1);
}

// Handle completed workflow
if (res.status === "success") {
  console.log(res.result ?? res);
} else {
  console.log(res);
}

# Calling an Agent From a Workflow
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows/calling-agent

This example demonstrates how to create a workflow that calls an AI agent to suggest activities for the provided weather conditions, and execute it within a workflow step.

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @mastra/core
```

## Define Planning Agent

Define a planning agent which leverages an LLM call to plan activities given a location and corresponding weather conditions.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/planning-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const llm = openai("gpt-4o");

// Create a new agent for activity planning
const planningAgent = new Agent({
  name: "planningAgent",
  model: llm,
  instructions: `

        Maintain this exact formatting for consistency, using the emoji and section headers as shown.
      `,
});

export { planningAgent };
```

## Define Activity Planning Workflow

Define the activity planning workflow with 2 steps: one to fetch the weather via a network call, and another to plan activities using the planning agent.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/agent-workflow.ts"
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

// Helper function to convert numeric weather codes to human-readable descriptions
function getWeatherCondition(code: number): string {
  const conditions: Record<number, string> = {
    0: "Clear sky",
    1: "Mainly clear",
    2: "Partly cloudy",
    3: "Overcast",
    45: "Foggy",
    48: "Depositing rime fog",
    51: "Light drizzle",
    53: "Moderate drizzle",
    55: "Dense drizzle",
    61: "Slight rain",
    63: "Moderate rain",
    65: "Heavy rain",
    71: "Slight snow fall",
    73: "Moderate snow fall",
    75: "Heavy snow fall",
    95: "Thunderstorm",
  };
  return conditions[code] || "Unknown";
}

const forecastSchema = z.object({
  date: z.string(),
  maxTemp: z.number(),
  minTemp: z.number(),
  precipitationChance: z.number(),
  condition: z.string(),
  location: z.string(),
});
```

### Step 1: Create a step to fetch weather data for a given city

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/agent-workflow.ts"
const fetchWeather = createStep({
  id: "fetch-weather",
  description: "Fetches weather forecast for a given city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: forecastSchema,
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    if (!inputData) {
      throw new Error("Trigger data not found");
    }

    // First API call: Convert city name to latitude and longitude
    const geocodingUrl = `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${encodeURIComponent(inputData.city)}&count=1`;
    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(geocodingUrl);
    const geocodingData = (await geocodingResponse.json()) as {
      results: { latitude: number; longitude: number; name: string }[];
    };

    if (!geocodingData.results?.[0]) {
      throw new Error(`Location '${inputData.city}' not found`);
    }

    const { latitude, longitude, name } = geocodingData.results[0];

    // Second API call: Get weather data using coordinates
    const weatherUrl = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=precipitation,weathercode&timezone=auto,&hourly=precipitation_probability,temperature_2m`;
    const response = await fetch(weatherUrl);
    const data = (await response.json()) as {
      current: {
        time: string;
        precipitation: number;
        weathercode: number;
      };
      hourly: {
        precipitation_probability: number[];
        temperature_2m: number[];
      };
    };

    const forecast = {
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      maxTemp: Math.max(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      minTemp: Math.min(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      condition: getWeatherCondition(data.current.weathercode),
      location: name,
      precipitationChance: data.hourly.precipitation_probability.reduce(
        (acc, curr) => Math.max(acc, curr),
        0,
      ),
    };

    return forecast;
  },
});
```

### Step 2: Create a step to generate activity recommendations using the agent

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/agent-workflow.ts"
const planActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-activities",
  description: "Suggests activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `Based on the following weather forecast for ${forecast.location}, suggest appropriate activities:
      ${JSON.stringify(forecast, null, 2)}
      `;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";
    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }

    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});

const activityPlanningWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  steps: [fetchWeather, planActivities],
  id: "activity-planning-step1-single-day",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("The city to get the weather for"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
})
  .then(fetchWeather)
  .then(planActivities);

activityPlanningWorkflow.commit();

export { activityPlanningWorkflow };
```

## Register Agent and Workflow instances with Mastra class

Register the planning agent and activity planning workflow with the mastra instance.
This is critical for enabling access to the planning agent within the activity planning workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { createLogger } from "@mastra/core/logger";
import { activityPlanningWorkflow } from "./workflows/agent-workflow";
import { planningAgent } from "./agents/planning-agent";

// Create a new Mastra instance and register components
const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    activityPlanningWorkflow,
  },
  agents: {
    planningAgent,
  },
  logger: createLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});

export { mastra };
```

## Execute the activity planning workflow

Here, we'll get the activity planning workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { mastra } from "./";

const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("activityPlanningWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

// Start the workflow with New York as the city input
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { city: "New York" } });
console.dir(result, { depth: null });
```

# Workflow with Conditional Branching
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows/conditional-branching

Workflows often need to follow different paths based on some condition.
This example demonstrates how to use the `branch` construct to create conditional flows within your workflows.

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @mastra/core
```

## Define Planning Agent

Define a planning agent which leverages an LLM call to plan activities given a location and corresponding weather conditions.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/planning-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const llm = openai("gpt-4o");

// Define the planning agent that generates activity recommendations
// based on weather conditions and location
const planningAgent = new Agent({
  name: "planningAgent",
  model: llm,

      `,
});

export { planningAgent };
```

## Define Activity Planning Workflow

Define the planning workflow with 3 steps: one to fetch the weather via a network call, one to plan activities, and another to plan only indoor activities.
Both using the planning agent.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/conditional-workflow.ts"
import { z } from "zod";
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";

// Helper function to convert weather codes to human-readable conditions
function getWeatherCondition(code: number): string {
  const conditions: Record<number, string> = {
    0: "Clear sky",
    1: "Mainly clear",
    2: "Partly cloudy",
    3: "Overcast",
    45: "Foggy",
    48: "Depositing rime fog",
    51: "Light drizzle",
    53: "Moderate drizzle",
    55: "Dense drizzle",
    61: "Slight rain",
    63: "Moderate rain",
    65: "Heavy rain",
    71: "Slight snow fall",
    73: "Moderate snow fall",
    75: "Heavy snow fall",
    95: "Thunderstorm",
  };
  return conditions[code] || "Unknown";
}

const forecastSchema = z.object({
  date: z.string(),
  maxTemp: z.number(),
  minTemp: z.number(),
  precipitationChance: z.number(),
  condition: z.string(),
  location: z.string(),
});
```

### Step to fetch weather data for a given city

Makes API calls to get current weather conditions and forecast

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/conditional-workflow.ts"
const fetchWeather = createStep({
  id: "fetch-weather",
  description: "Fetches weather forecast for a given city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: forecastSchema,
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    if (!inputData) {
      throw new Error("Trigger data not found");
    }

    const geocodingUrl = `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${encodeURIComponent(inputData.city)}&count=1`;
    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(geocodingUrl);
    const geocodingData = (await geocodingResponse.json()) as {
      results: { latitude: number; longitude: number; name: string }[];
    };

    if (!geocodingData.results?.[0]) {
      throw new Error(`Location '${inputData.city}' not found`);
    }

    const { latitude, longitude, name } = geocodingData.results[0];

    const weatherUrl = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=precipitation,weathercode&timezone=auto,&hourly=precipitation_probability,temperature_2m`;
    const response = await fetch(weatherUrl);
    const data = (await response.json()) as {
      current: {
        time: string;
        precipitation: number;
        weathercode: number;
      };
      hourly: {
        precipitation_probability: number[];
        temperature_2m: number[];
      };
    };

    const forecast = {
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      maxTemp: Math.max(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      minTemp: Math.min(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      condition: getWeatherCondition(data.current.weathercode),
      location: name,
      precipitationChance: data.hourly.precipitation_probability.reduce(
        (acc, curr) => Math.max(acc, curr),
        0,
      ),
    };

    return forecast;
  },
});
```

### Step to plan activities based on weather conditions

Uses the planning agent to generate activity recommendations

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/conditional-workflow.ts"
const planActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-activities",
  description: "Suggests activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `Based on the following weather forecast for ${forecast.location}, suggest appropriate activities:
      ${JSON.stringify(forecast, null, 2)}
      `;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }

    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

### Step to plan indoor activities only

Used when precipitation chance is high

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/conditional-workflow.ts"
const planIndoorActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-indoor-activities",
  description: "Suggests indoor activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `In case it rains, plan indoor activities for ${forecast.location} on ${forecast.date}`;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }

    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

### Main workflow

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/conditional-workflow.ts"
const activityPlanningWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "activity-planning-workflow-step2-if-else",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("The city to get the weather for"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
})
  .then(fetchWeather)
  .branch([
    // Branch for high precipitation (indoor activities)
    [
      async ({ inputData }) => {
        return inputData?.precipitationChance > 50;
      },
      planIndoorActivities,
    ],
    // Branch for low precipitation (outdoor activities)
    [
      async ({ inputData }) => {
        return inputData?.precipitationChance <= 50;
      },
      planActivities,
    ],
  ]);

activityPlanningWorkflow.commit();

export { activityPlanningWorkflow };
```

## Register Agent and Workflow instances with Mastra class

Register the agents and workflow with the mastra instance.
This is critical for enabling access to the agents within the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { createLogger } from "@mastra/core/logger";
import { activityPlanningWorkflow } from "./workflows/conditional-workflow";
import { planningAgent } from "./agents/planning-agent";

// Initialize Mastra with the activity planning workflow
// This enables the workflow to be executed and access the planning agent
const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    activityPlanningWorkflow,
  },
  agents: {
    planningAgent,
  },
  logger: createLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});

export { mastra };
```

## Execute the activity planning workflow

Here, we'll get the activity planning workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { mastra } from "./";

const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("activityPlanningWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

// Start the workflow with a city
// This will fetch weather and plan activities based on conditions
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { city: "New York" } });
console.dir(result, { depth: null });
```

# Looping step execution
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows/control-flow

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @mastra/core
```

## Define Looping workflow

Defines a workflow which calls the executes a nested workflow until the provided condition is met.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="looping-workflow.ts"
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

// Step that increments the input value by 1
const incrementStep = createStep({
  id: "increment",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    return { value: inputData.value + 1 };
  },
});

// Step that logs the current value (side effect)
const sideEffectStep = createStep({
  id: "side-effect",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    console.log("log", inputData.value);
    return { value: inputData.value };
  },
});

// Final step that returns the final value
const finalStep = createStep({
  id: "final",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    return { value: inputData.value };
  },
});

// Create a workflow that:
// 1. Increments a number until it reaches 10
// 2. Logs each increment (side effect)
// 3. Returns the final value
const workflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "increment-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
})
  .dountil(
    // Nested workflow that performs the increment and logging
    createWorkflow({
      id: "increment-workflow",
      inputSchema: z.object({
        value: z.number(),
      }),
      outputSchema: z.object({
        value: z.number(),
      }),
      steps: [incrementStep, sideEffectStep],
    })
      .then(incrementStep)
      .then(sideEffectStep)
      .commit(),
    // Condition to check if we should stop the loop
    async ({ inputData }) => inputData.value >= 10,
  )
  .then(finalStep);

workflow.commit();

export { workflow as incrementWorkflow };
```

## Register Workflow instance with Mastra class

Register the workflow with the mastra instance.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { incrementWorkflow } from "./workflows";

// Initialize Mastra with the increment workflow
// This enables the workflow to be executed
const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    incrementWorkflow,
  },
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});

export { mastra };
```

## Execute the workflow

Here, we'll get the increment workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { mastra } from "./";

const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("incrementWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

// Start the workflow with initial value 0
// This will increment until reaching 10
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { value: 0 } });
console.dir(result, { depth: null });

# Human in the Loop Workflow
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows/human-in-the-loop

Human-in-the-loop workflows allow you to pause execution at specific points to collect user input, make decisions, or perform actions that require human judgment.
This example demonstrates how to create a workflow with human intervention points.

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @mastra/core @inquirer/prompts
```

## Define Agents

Define the travel agents.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/travel-agents.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const llm = openai("gpt-4o");

// Agent that generates multiple holiday options
// Returns a JSON array of locations and descriptions
export const summaryTravelAgent = new Agent({
  name: "summaryTravelAgent",
  model: llm,
  instructions: `
  You are a travel agent who is given a user prompt about what kind of holiday they want to go on.
  You then generate 3 different options for the holiday. Return the suggestions as a JSON array {"location": "string", "description": "string"}[]. Don't format as markdown.
  Make the options as different as possible from each other.
  Also make the plan very short and summarized.
  `,
});

// Agent that creates detailed travel plans
// Takes the selected option and generates a comprehensive itinerary
export const travelAgent = new Agent({
  name: "travelAgent",
  model: llm,
  instructions: `
  You are a travel agent who is given a user prompt about what kind of holiday they want to go on. A summary of the plan is provided as well as the location.
  You then generate a detailed travel plan for the holiday.
  `,
});
```

## Define Suspendable workflow

Defines a workflow which includes a suspending step: `humanInputStep`.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/human-in-the-loop-workflow.ts"
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

// Step that generates multiple holiday options based on user's vacation description
// Uses the summaryTravelAgent to create diverse travel suggestions
const generateSuggestionsStep = createStep({
  id: "generate-suggestions",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    vacationDescription: z.string().describe("The description of the vacation"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    suggestions: z.array(z.string()),
    vacationDescription: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    if (!mastra) {
      throw new Error("Mastra is not initialized");
    }

    const { vacationDescription } = inputData;
    const result = await mastra.getAgent("summaryTravelAgent").generate([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: vacationDescription,
      },
    ]);
    console.log(result.text);
    return { suggestions: JSON.parse(result.text), vacationDescription };
  },
});

// Step that pauses the workflow to get user input
// Allows the user to select their preferred holiday option from the suggestions
// Uses suspend/resume mechanism to handle the interaction
const humanInputStep = createStep({
  id: "human-input",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    suggestions: z.array(z.string()),
    vacationDescription: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    selection: z.string().describe("The selection of the user"),
    vacationDescription: z.string(),
  }),
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    selection: z.string().describe("The selection of the user"),
  }),
  suspendSchema: z.object({
    suggestions: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, resumeData, suspend, getInitData }) => {
    if (!resumeData?.selection) {
      return suspend({ suggestions: inputData?.suggestions });
    }

    return {
      selection: resumeData?.selection,
      vacationDescription: inputData?.vacationDescription,
    };
  },
});

// Step that creates a detailed travel plan based on the user's selection
// Uses the travelAgent to generate comprehensive holiday details
const travelPlannerStep = createStep({
  id: "travel-planner",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    selection: z.string().describe("The selection of the user"),
    vacationDescription: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    travelPlan: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const travelAgent = mastra?.getAgent("travelAgent");
    if (!travelAgent) {
      throw new Error("Travel agent is not initialized");
    }

    const { selection, vacationDescription } = inputData;
    const result = await travelAgent.generate([
      { role: "assistant", content: vacationDescription },
      { role: "user", content: selection || "" },
    ]);
    console.log(result.text);
    return { travelPlan: result.text };
  },
});

// Main workflow that orchestrates the holiday planning process:
// 1. Generates multiple options
// 2. Gets user input
// 3. Creates detailed plan
const travelAgentWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "travel-agent-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    vacationDescription: z.string().describe("The description of the vacation"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    travelPlan: z.string(),
  }),
})
  .then(generateSuggestionsStep)
  .then(humanInputStep)
  .then(travelPlannerStep);

travelAgentWorkflow.commit();

export { travelAgentWorkflow, humanInputStep };
```

## Register Agent and Workflow instances with Mastra class

Register the agents and the weather workflow with the mastra instance.
This is critical for enabling access to the agents within the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { createLogger } from "@mastra/core/logger";
import { travelAgentWorkflow } from "./workflows/human-in-the-loop-workflow";
import { summaryTravelAgent, travelAgent } from "./agents/travel-agent";

// Initialize Mastra instance with:
// - The travel planning workflow
// - Both travel agents (summary and detailed planning)
// - Logging configuration
const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    travelAgentWorkflow,
  },
  agents: {
    travelAgent,
    summaryTravelAgent,
  },
  logger: createLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});

export { mastra };
```

## Execute the suspendable weather workflow

Here, we'll get the weather workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.
In addition to this, we'll resume the `humanInputStep` after collecting user input with the readline package.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { mastra } from "./";
import { select } from "@inquirer/prompts";
import { humanInputStep } from "./workflows/human-in-the-loop-workflow";

const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("travelAgentWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

// Start the workflow with initial vacation description
const result = await run.start({
  inputData: { vacationDescription: "I want to go to the beach" },
});

console.log("result", result);

const suggStep = result?.steps?.["generate-suggestions"];

// If suggestions were generated successfully, proceed with user interaction
if (suggStep.status === "success") {
  const suggestions = suggStep.output?.suggestions;

  // Present options to user and get their selection
  const userInput = await select<string>({
    message: "Choose your holiday destination",
    choices: suggestions.map(
      ({ location, description }: { location: string; description: string }) =>
        `- ${location}: ${description}`,
    ),
  });

  console.log("Selected:", userInput);

  // Prepare to resume the workflow with user's selection
  console.log("resuming from", result, "with", {
    inputData: {
      selection: userInput,
      vacationDescription: "I want to go to the beach",
      suggestions: suggStep?.output?.suggestions,
    },
    step: humanInputStep,
  });

  const result2 = await run.resume({
    resumeData: {
      selection: userInput,
    },
    step: humanInputStep,
  });

  console.dir(result2, { depth: null });
}
```

Human-in-the-loop workflows are powerful for building systems that blend automation with human judgment, such as:

- Content moderation systems
- Approval workflows
- Supervised AI systems
- Customer service automation with escalation

# Inngest Workflow
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows/inngest-workflow

This example demonstrates how to build an Inngest workflow with Mastra.

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @mastra/inngest inngest @mastra/core @mastra/deployer @hono/node-server @ai-sdk/openai

docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  inngest/inngest \
  inngest dev -u http://host.docker.internal:3000/inngest/api
```

Alternatively, you can use the Inngest CLI for local development by following the official [Inngest Dev Server guide](https://www.inngest.com/docs/dev-server).

## Define the Planning Agent

Define a planning agent which leverages an LLM call to plan activities given a location and corresponding weather conditions.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/planning-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create a new planning agent that uses the OpenAI model
const planningAgent = new Agent({
  name: "planningAgent",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  instructions: `
        You are a local activities and travel expert who excels at weather-based planning. Analyze the weather data and provide practical activity recommendations.

        📅 [Day, Month Date, Year]
        ═══════════════════════════

        🌡️ WEATHER SUMMARY
        • Conditions: [brief description]
        • Temperature: [X°C/Y°F to A°C/B°F]
        • Precipitation: [X% chance]

        🌅 MORNING ACTIVITIES
        Outdoor:
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]
          Best timing: [specific time range]
          Note: [relevant weather consideration]

        🌞 AFTERNOON ACTIVITIES
        Outdoor:
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]
          Best timing: [specific time range]
          Note: [relevant weather consideration]

        🏠 INDOOR ALTERNATIVES
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific venue]

        Guidelines:
        - Suggest 2-3 time-specific outdoor activities per day
        - Include 1-2 indoor backup options
        - For precipitation >50%, lead with indoor activities
        - All activities must be specific to the location
        - Include specific venues, trails, or locations
        - Consider activity intensity based on temperature
        - Keep descriptions concise but informative

        Maintain this exact formatting for consistency, using the emoji and section headers as shown.
      `,
});

export { planningAgent };
```

## Define the Activity Planner Workflow

Define the activity planner workflow with 3 steps: one to fetch the weather via a network call, one to plan activities, and another to plan only indoor activities.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
import { init } from "@mastra/inngest";
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { z } from "zod";

const { createWorkflow, createStep } = init(
  new Inngest({
    id: "mastra",
    baseUrl: `http://localhost:3000`,
  }),
);

// Helper function to convert weather codes to human-readable descriptions
function getWeatherCondition(code: number): string {
  const conditions: Record<number, string> = {
    0: "Clear sky",
    1: "Mainly clear",
    2: "Partly cloudy",
    3: "Overcast",
    45: "Foggy",
    48: "Depositing rime fog",
    51: "Light drizzle",
    53: "Moderate drizzle",
    55: "Dense drizzle",
    61: "Slight rain",
    63: "Moderate rain",
    65: "Heavy rain",
    71: "Slight snow fall",
    73: "Moderate snow fall",
    75: "Heavy snow fall",
    95: "Thunderstorm",
  };
  return conditions[code] || "Unknown";
}

const forecastSchema = z.object({
  date: z.string(),
  maxTemp: z.number(),
  minTemp: z.number(),
  precipitationChance: z.number(),
  condition: z.string(),
  location: z.string(),
});
```

#### Step 1: Fetch weather data for a given city

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
const fetchWeather = createStep({
  id: "fetch-weather",
  description: "Fetches weather forecast for a given city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: forecastSchema,
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    if (!inputData) {
      throw new Error("Trigger data not found");
    }

    // Get latitude and longitude for the city
    const geocodingUrl = `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${encodeURIComponent(inputData.city)}&count=1`;
    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(geocodingUrl);
    const geocodingData = (await geocodingResponse.json()) as {
      results: { latitude: number; longitude: number; name: string }[];
    };

    if (!geocodingData.results?.[0]) {
      throw new Error(`Location '${inputData.city}' not found`);
    }

    const { latitude, longitude, name } = geocodingData.results[0];

    // Fetch weather data using the coordinates
    const weatherUrl = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=precipitation,weathercode&timezone=auto,&hourly=precipitation_probability,temperature_2m`;
    const response = await fetch(weatherUrl);
    const data = (await response.json()) as {
      current: {
        time: string;
        precipitation: number;
        weathercode: number;
      };
      hourly: {
        precipitation_probability: number[];
        temperature_2m: number[];
      };
    };

    const forecast = {
      date: new Date().toISOString(),
      maxTemp: Math.max(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      minTemp: Math.min(...data.hourly.temperature_2m),
      condition: getWeatherCondition(data.current.weathercode),
      location: name,
      precipitationChance: data.hourly.precipitation_probability.reduce(
        (acc, curr) => Math.max(acc, curr),
        0,
      ),
    };

    return forecast;
  },
});
```

#### Step 2: Suggest activities (indoor or outdoor) based on weather

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
const planActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-activities",
  description: "Suggests activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `Based on the following weather forecast for ${forecast.location}, suggest appropriate activities:
      ${JSON.stringify(forecast, null, 2)}
      `;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }

    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

#### Step 3: Suggest indoor activities only (for rainy weather)

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
const planIndoorActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-indoor-activities",
  description: "Suggests indoor activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `In case it rains, plan indoor activities for ${forecast.location} on ${forecast.date}`;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }

    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

## Define the activity planner workflow

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/inngest-workflow.ts"
const activityPlanningWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "activity-planning-workflow-step2-if-else",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("The city to get the weather for"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
})
  .then(fetchWeather)
  .branch([
    [
      // If precipitation chance is greater than 50%, suggest indoor activities
      async ({ inputData }) => {
        return inputData?.precipitationChance > 50;
      },
      planIndoorActivities,
    ],
    [
      // Otherwise, suggest a mix of activities
      async ({ inputData }) => {
        return inputData?.precipitationChance <= 50;
      },
      planActivities,
    ],
  ]);

activityPlanningWorkflow.commit();

export { activityPlanningWorkflow };
```

## Register Agent and Workflow instances with Mastra class

Register the agents and workflow with the mastra instance. This allows access to the agents within the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { serve as inngestServe } from "@mastra/inngest";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
import { activityPlanningWorkflow } from "./workflows/inngest-workflow";
import { planningAgent } from "./agents/planning-agent";
import { realtimeMiddleware } from "@inngest/realtime";

// Create an Inngest instance for workflow orchestration and event handling
const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "mastra",
  baseUrl: `http://localhost:3000`, // URL of your local Inngest server
  isDev: true,
  middleware: [realtimeMiddleware()], // Enable real-time updates in the Inngest dashboard
});

// Create and configure the main Mastra instance
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    activityPlanningWorkflow,
  },
  agents: {
    planningAgent,
  },
  server: {
    host: "0.0.0.0",
    apiRoutes: [
      {
        path: "/api/inngest", // API endpoint for Inngest to send events to
        method: "ALL",
        createHandler: async ({ mastra }) => inngestServe({ mastra, inngest }),
      },
    ],
  },
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});
```

## Execute the activity planner workflow

Here, we'll get the activity planner workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { mastra } from "./";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { createHonoServer } from "@mastra/deployer/server";

const app = await createHonoServer(mastra);

// Start the server on port 3000 so Inngest can send events to it
const srv = serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port: 3000,
});

const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("activityPlanningWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

// Start the workflow with the required input data (city name)
// This will trigger the workflow steps and stream the result to the console
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { city: "New York" } });
console.dir(result, { depth: null });

// Close the server after the workflow run is complete
srv.close();
```

After running the workflow, you can view and monitor your workflow runs in real time using the Inngest dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

# Parallel Execution with Steps
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows/parallel-steps

When building AI applications, you often need to process multiple independent tasks simultaneously to improve efficiency.
We make this functionality a core part of workflows through the `.parallel` method.

## Setup

```sh copy
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @mastra/core
```

## Define Planning Agent

Define a planning agent which leverages an LLM call to plan activities given a location and corresponding weather conditions.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/planning-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const llm = openai("gpt-4o");

// Define the planning agent with specific instructions for formatting
// and structuring weather-based activity recommendations
const planningAgent = new Agent({
  name: "planningAgent",
  model: llm,
  instructions: `

        🌅 MORNING ACTIVITIES
        Outdoor:
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]
          Best timing: [specific time range]
          Note: [relevant weather consideration]

        🌞 AFTERNOON ACTIVITIES
        Outdoor:
        • [Activity Name] - [Brief description including specific location/route]

          Ideal for: [weather condition that would trigger this alternative]

        ⚠️ SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
        • [Any relevant weather warnings, UV index, wind conditions, etc.]

        Guidelines:
        - Suggest 2-3 time-specific outdoor activities per day
        - Include 1-2 indoor backup options
        - For precipitation >50%, lead with indoor activities

        Maintain this exact formatting for consistency, using the emoji and section headers as shown.
      `,
});

export { planningAgent };
```

## Define Synthesize Agent

Define a synthesize agent which takes planned indoor and outdoor activities and provides a full report on the day.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="agents/synthesize-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const llm = openai("gpt-4o");

// Define the synthesize agent that combines indoor and outdoor activity plans
// into a comprehensive report, considering weather conditions and alternatives
const synthesizeAgent = new Agent({
  name: "synthesizeAgent",
  model: llm,
  instructions: `
  You are given two different blocks of text, one about indoor activities and one about outdoor activities.
  Make this into a full report about the day and the possibilities depending on whether it rains or not.
  `,
});

export { synthesizeAgent };
```

## Define Parallel Workflow

Here, we'll define a workflow which orchestrates a parallel -> sequential flow between the planning steps and the synthesize step.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
import { z } from "zod";
import { createStep, createWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";

const forecastSchema = z.object({
  date: z.string(),
  maxTemp: z.number(),
  minTemp: z.number(),
  precipitationChance: z.number(),
  condition: z.string(),
  location: z.string(),
});

// Step to fetch weather data for a given city
// Makes API calls to get current weather conditions and forecast
const fetchWeather = createStep({
  id: "fetch-weather",
  description: "Fetches weather forecast for a given city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: forecastSchema,
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {

      throw new Error("Trigger data not found");
    }

    const geocodingUrl = `https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${encodeURIComponent(inputData.city)}&count=1`;
    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(geocodingUrl);
    const geocodingData = (await geocodingResponse.json()) as {
      results: { latitude: number; longitude: number; name: string }[];
    };

    if (!geocodingData.results?.[0]) {
      throw new Error(`Location '${inputData.city}' not found`);
    }

    const { latitude, longitude, name } = geocodingData.results[0];

    const weatherUrl = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&current=precipitation,weathercode&timezone=auto,&hourly=precipitation_probability,temperature_2m`;
    const response = await fetch(weatherUrl);
    const data = (await response.json()) as {
      current: {

      ),
    };

    return forecast;
  },
});
```

### Step to plan outdoor activities based on weather conditions

Uses the planning agent to generate activity recommendations

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
const planActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-activities",
  description: "Suggests activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `Based on the following weather forecast for ${forecast.location}, suggest appropriate activities:
      ${JSON.stringify(forecast, null, 2)}
      `;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }
    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

### Helper function to convert weather codes to human-readable conditions

Maps numeric codes from the weather API to descriptive strings

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
function getWeatherCondition(code: number): string {
  const conditions: Record<number, string> = {
    0: "Clear sky",
    1: "Mainly clear",
    2: "Partly cloudy",
    3: "Overcast",
    45: "Foggy",
    48: "Depositing rime fog",
    51: "Light drizzle",
    53: "Moderate drizzle",
    55: "Dense drizzle",
    61: "Slight rain",
    63: "Moderate rain",
    65: "Heavy rain",
    71: "Slight snow fall",
    73: "Moderate snow fall",
    75: "Heavy snow fall",
    95: "Thunderstorm",
  };
  return conditions[code] || "Unknown";
}

// Step to plan indoor activities as backup options
// Generates alternative indoor activities in case of bad weather
const planIndoorActivities = createStep({
  id: "plan-indoor-activities",
  description: "Suggests indoor activities based on weather conditions",
  inputSchema: forecastSchema,
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const forecast = inputData;

    if (!forecast) {
      throw new Error("Forecast data not found");
    }

    const prompt = `In case it rains, plan indoor activities for ${forecast.location} on ${forecast.date}`;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("planningAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Planning agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }
    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

### Step to synthesize and combine indoor/outdoor activity plans

Creates a comprehensive plan that considers both options

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
const synthesizeStep = createStep({
  id: "sythesize-step",
  description: "Synthesizes the results of the indoor and outdoor activities",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    "plan-activities": z.object({
      activities: z.string(),
    }),
    "plan-indoor-activities": z.object({
      activities: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra }) => {
    const indoorActivities = inputData?.["plan-indoor-activities"];
    const outdoorActivities = inputData?.["plan-activities"];

    const prompt = `Indoor activities:
      ${indoorActivities?.activities}

      Outdoor activities:
      ${outdoorActivities?.activities}

      There is a chance of rain so be prepared to do indoor activities if needed.`;

    const agent = mastra?.getAgent("synthesizeAgent");
    if (!agent) {
      throw new Error("Synthesize agent not found");
    }

    const response = await agent.stream([
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt,
      },
    ]);

    let activitiesText = "";

    for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
      process.stdout.write(chunk);
      activitiesText += chunk;
    }

    return {
      activities: activitiesText,
    };
  },
});
```

### Main workflow

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="workflows/parallel-workflow.ts"
const activityPlanningWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "plan-both-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    activities: z.string(),
  }),
  steps: [fetchWeather, planActivities, planIndoorActivities, synthesizeStep],
})
  .then(fetchWeather)
  .parallel([planActivities, planIndoorActivities])
  .then(synthesizeStep)
  .commit();

export { activityPlanningWorkflow };
```

## Register Agent and Workflow instances with Mastra class

Register the agents and workflow with the mastra instance.
This is critical for enabling access to the agents within the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { createLogger } from "@mastra/core/logger";
import { activityPlanningWorkflow } from "./workflows/parallel-workflow";
import { planningAgent } from "./agents/planning-agent";
import { synthesizeAgent } from "./agents/synthesize-agent";

// Initialize Mastra with required agents and workflows
// This setup enables agent access within the workflow steps
const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    activityPlanningWorkflow,
  },
  agents: {
    planningAgent,
    synthesizeAgent,
  },
  logger: createLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});

export { mastra };
```

## Execute the activity planning workflow

Here, we'll get the weather workflow from the mastra instance, then create a run and execute the created run with the required inputData.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="exec.ts"
import { mastra } from "./";

const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("activityPlanningWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

// Execute the workflow with a specific city
// This will run through all steps and generate activity recommendations
const result = await run.start({ inputData: { city: "Ibiza" } });
console.dir(result, { depth: null });
```

# Branching Paths
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/branching-paths

When processing data, you often need to take different actions based on intermediate results. This example shows how to create a legacy workflow that splits into separate paths, where each path executes different steps based on the output of a previous step.

## Control Flow Diagram

This example shows how to create a legacy workflow that splits into separate paths, where each path executes different steps based on the output of a previous step.

Here's the control flow diagram:

  src="/subscribed-chains.png"
  alt="Diagram showing workflow with branching paths"
/>

## Creating the Steps

Let's start by creating the steps and initializing the workflow.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod"

const stepOne = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepOne",
  execute: async ({ context }) => ({
    doubledValue: context.triggerData.inputValue * 2
  })
});

const stepTwo = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepTwo",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const stepOneResult = context.getStepResult<{ doubledValue: number }>("stepOne");
    if (!stepOneResult) {
      return { isDivisibleByFive: false }
    }

    return { isDivisibleByFive: stepOneResult.doubledValue % 5 === 0 }
  }
});


const stepThree = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepThree",
  execute: async ({ context }) =>{
    const stepOneResult = context.getStepResult<{ doubledValue: number }>("stepOne");
    if (!stepOneResult) {
      return { incrementedValue: 0 }
    }

    return { incrementedValue: stepOneResult.doubledValue + 1 }
  }
});

const stepFour = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepFour",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const stepThreeResult = context.getStepResult<{ incrementedValue: number }>("stepThree");
    if (!stepThreeResult) {
      return { isDivisibleByThree: false }
    }

    return { isDivisibleByThree: stepThreeResult.incrementedValue % 3 === 0 }
  }
});

// New step that depends on both branches
const finalStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "finalStep",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Get results from both branches using getStepResult
    const stepTwoResult = context.getStepResult<{ isDivisibleByFive: boolean }>("stepTwo");
    const stepFourResult = context.getStepResult<{ isDivisibleByThree: boolean }>("stepFour");

    const isDivisibleByFive = stepTwoResult?.isDivisibleByFive || false;
    const isDivisibleByThree = stepFourResult?.isDivisibleByThree || false;

    return {
      summary: `The number ${context.triggerData.inputValue} when doubled ${isDivisibleByFive ? 'is' : 'is not'} divisible by 5, and when doubled and incremented ${isDivisibleByThree ? 'is' : 'is not'} divisible by 3.`,
      isDivisibleByFive,
      isDivisibleByThree
    }
  }
});

// Build the workflow
const myWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputValue: z.number(),
  }),
});
```

## Branching Paths and Chaining Steps

Now let's configure the legacy workflow with branching paths and merge them using the compound `.after([])` syntax.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Create two parallel branches
myWorkflow
  // First branch
  .step(stepOne)
  .then(stepTwo)

  // Second branch
  .after(stepOne)
  .step(stepThree)
  .then(stepFour)

  // Merge both branches using compound after syntax
  .after([stepTwo, stepFour])
  .step(finalStep)
  .commit();

const { start } = myWorkflow.createRun();

const result = await start({ triggerData: { inputValue: 3 } });
console.log(result.steps.finalStep.output.summary);
// Output: "The number 3 when doubled is not divisible by 5, and when doubled and incremented is divisible by 3."
```

## Advanced Branching and Merging

You can create more complex workflows with multiple branches and merge points:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const complexWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "complex-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputValue: z.number(),
  }),
});

// Create multiple branches with different merge points
complexWorkflow
  // Main step
  .step(stepOne)

  // First branch
  .then(stepTwo)

  // Second branch
  .after(stepOne)
  .step(stepThree)
  .then(stepFour)

  // Third branch (another path from stepOne)
  .after(stepOne)
  .step(
    new LegacyStep({
      id: "alternativePath",
      execute: async ({ context }) => {
        const stepOneResult = context.getStepResult<{ doubledValue: number }>(
          "stepOne",
        );
        return {
          result: (stepOneResult?.doubledValue || 0) * 3,
        };
      },
    }),
  )

  // Merge first and second branches
  .after([stepTwo, stepFour])
  .step(
    new LegacyStep({
      id: "partialMerge",
      execute: async ({ context }) => {
        const stepTwoResult = context.getStepResult<{
          isDivisibleByFive: boolean;
        }>("stepTwo");
        const stepFourResult = context.getStepResult<{
          isDivisibleByThree: boolean;
        }>("stepFour");

        return {
          intermediateResult: "Processed first two branches",
          branchResults: {
            branch1: stepTwoResult?.isDivisibleByFive,
            branch2: stepFourResult?.isDivisibleByThree,
          },
        };
      },
    }),
  )

  // Final merge of all branches
  .after(["partialMerge", "alternativePath"])
  .step(
    new LegacyStep({
      id: "finalMerge",
      execute: async ({ context }) => {
        const partialMergeResult = context.getStepResult<{
          intermediateResult: string;
          branchResults: { branch1: boolean; branch2: boolean };
        }>("partialMerge");

        const alternativePathResult = context.getStepResult<{ result: number }>(
          "alternativePath",
        );

        return {
          finalResult: "All branches processed",
          combinedData: {
            fromPartialMerge: partialMergeResult?.branchResults,
            fromAlternativePath: alternativePathResult?.result,
          },
        };
      },
    }),
  )
  .commit();
```

# Calling an Agent From a Workflow (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/calling-agent

This example demonstrates how to create a legacy workflow that calls an AI agent to process messages and generate responses, and execute it within a legacy workflow step.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const penguin = new Agent({

import { GithubLink } from "@/components/github-link";

# Workflow (Legacy) with Conditional Branching (experimental)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/conditional-branching

Workflows often need to follow different paths based on conditions. This example demonstrates how to use `if` and `else` to create conditional branches in your legacy workflows.

## Basic If/Else Example

This example shows a simple legacy workflow that takes different paths based on a numeric value:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Step that provides the initial value
const startStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "start",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Get the value from the trigger data
    const value = context.triggerData.inputValue;
    return { value };
  },
});

// Step that handles high values
const highValueStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "highValue",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    result: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const value = context.getStepResult<{ value: number }>("start")?.value;
    return { result: `High value processed: ${value}` };
  },
});

// Step that handles low values
const lowValueStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "lowValue",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    result: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const value = context.getStepResult<{ value: number }>("start")?.value;
    return { result: `Low value processed: ${value}` };
  },
});

// Final step that summarizes the result
const finalStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "final",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    summary: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Get the result from whichever branch executed
    const highResult = context.getStepResult<{ result: string }>(
      "highValue",
    )?.result;
    const lowResult = context.getStepResult<{ result: string }>(
      "lowValue",
    )?.result;

    const result = highResult || lowResult;
    return { summary: `Processing complete: ${result}` };
  },
});

// Build the workflow with conditional branching
const conditionalWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "conditional-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputValue: z.number(),
  }),
});

conditionalWorkflow
  .step(startStep)
  .if(async ({ context }) => {
    const value = context.getStepResult<{ value: number }>("start")?.value ?? 0;
    return value >= 10; // Condition: value is 10 or greater
  })
  .then(highValueStep)
  .then(finalStep)
  .else()
  .then(lowValueStep)
  .then(finalStep) // Both branches converge on the final step
  .commit();

// Register the workflow
const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { conditionalWorkflow },
});

// Example usage
async function runWorkflow(inputValue: number) {
  const workflow = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("conditionalWorkflow");
  const { start } = workflow.createRun();

  const result = await start({
    triggerData: { inputValue },
  });

  console.log("Workflow result:", result.results);
  return result;
}

// Run with a high value (follows the "if" branch)
const result1 = await runWorkflow(15);
// Run with a low value (follows the "else" branch)
const result2 = await runWorkflow(5);

console.log("Result 1:", result1);
console.log("Result 2:", result2);
```

## Using Reference-Based Conditions

You can also use reference-based conditions with comparison operators:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Using reference-based conditions instead of functions
conditionalWorkflow
  .step(startStep)
  .if({
    ref: { step: startStep, path: "value" },
    query: { $gte: 10 }, // Condition: value is 10 or greater
  })
  .then(highValueStep)
  .then(finalStep)
  .else()
  .then(lowValueStep)
  .then(finalStep)
  .commit();
```

# Creating a Simple Workflow (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/creating-a-workflow

A workflow allows you to define and execute sequences of operations in a structured path. This example shows a legacy workflow with a single step.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const myWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    input: z.number(),
  }),
});

const stepOne = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepOne",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    doubledValue: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const doubledValue = context?.triggerData?.input * 2;
    return { doubledValue };
  },
});

myWorkflow.step(stepOne).commit();

const { runId, start } = myWorkflow.createRun();

const res = await start({
  triggerData: { input: 90 },
});

console.log(res.results);
```

# Workflow (Legacy) with Cyclical dependencies
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/cyclical-dependencies

Workflows support cyclical dependencies where steps can loop back based on conditions. The example below shows how to use conditional logic to create loops and handle repeated execution.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { LegacyWorkflow, LegacyStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

async function main() {
  const doubleValue = new LegacyStep({
    id: "doubleValue",
    description: "Doubles the input value",
    inputSchema: z.object({
      inputValue: z.number(),
    }),
    outputSchema: z.object({
      doubledValue: z.number(),
    }),
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      const doubledValue = context.inputValue * 2;
      return { doubledValue };
    },
  });

  const incrementByOne = new LegacyStep({
    id: "incrementByOne",
    description: "Adds 1 to the input value",
    outputSchema: z.object({
      incrementedValue: z.number(),
    }),
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      const valueToIncrement = context?.getStepResult<{ firstValue: number }>(
        "trigger",
      )?.firstValue;
      if (!valueToIncrement) throw new Error("No value to increment provided");
      const incrementedValue = valueToIncrement + 1;
      return { incrementedValue };
    },
  });

  const cyclicalWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
    name: "cyclical-workflow",
    triggerSchema: z.object({
      firstValue: z.number(),
    }),
  });

  cyclicalWorkflow
    .step(doubleValue, {
      variables: {
        inputValue: {
          step: "trigger",
          path: "firstValue",
        },
      },
    })
    .then(incrementByOne)
    .after(doubleValue)
    .step(doubleValue, {
      variables: {
        inputValue: {
          step: doubleValue,
          path: "doubledValue",
        },
      },
    })
    .commit();

  const { runId, start } = cyclicalWorkflow.createRun();

  console.log("Run", runId);

  const res = await start({ triggerData: { firstValue: 6 } });

  console.log(res.results);
}

main();

# Human in the Loop Workflow (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/human-in-the-loop

Human-in-the-loop workflows allow you to pause execution at specific points to collect user input, make decisions, or perform actions that require human judgment. This example demonstrates how to create a legacy workflow with human intervention points.

## How It Works

1. A workflow step can **suspend** execution using the `suspend()` function, optionally passing a payload with context for the human decision maker.
2. When the workflow is **resumed**, the human input is passed in the `context` parameter of the `resume()` call.
3. This input becomes available in the step's execution context as `context.inputData`, which is typed according to the step's `inputSchema`.
4. The step can then continue execution based on the human input.

This pattern allows for safe, type-checked human intervention in automated workflows.

## Interactive Terminal Example Using Inquirer

This example demonstrates how to use the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inquirer/prompts) library to collect user input directly from the terminal when a workflow is suspended, creating a truly interactive human-in-the-loop experience.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";
import { confirm, input, select } from "@inquirer/prompts";

// Step 1: Generate product recommendations
const generateRecommendations = new LegacyStep({
  id: "generateRecommendations",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    customerName: z.string(),
    recommendations: z.array(
      z.object({
        productId: z.string(),
        productName: z.string(),
        price: z.number(),
        description: z.string(),
      }),
    ),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const customerName = context.triggerData.customerName;

    // In a real application, you might call an API or ML model here
    // For this example, we'll return mock data
    return {
      customerName,
      recommendations: [
        {
          productId: "prod-001",
          productName: "Premium Widget",
          price: 99.99,
          description: "Our best-selling premium widget with advanced features",
        },
        {
          productId: "prod-002",
          productName: "Basic Widget",
          price: 49.99,
          description: "Affordable entry-level widget for beginners",
        },
        {
          productId: "prod-003",
          productName: "Widget Pro Plus",
          price: 149.99,
          description: "Professional-grade widget with extended warranty",
        },
      ],
    };
  },
});
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Step 2: Get human approval and customization for the recommendations
const reviewRecommendations = new LegacyStep({
  id: "reviewRecommendations",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    approvedProducts: z.array(z.string()),
    customerNote: z.string().optional(),
    offerDiscount: z.boolean().optional(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    finalRecommendations: z.array(
      z.object({
        productId: z.string(),
        productName: z.string(),
        price: z.number(),
      }),
    ),
    customerNote: z.string().optional(),
    offerDiscount: z.boolean(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    const { customerName, recommendations } = context.getStepResult(
      generateRecommendations,
    ) || {
      customerName: "",
      recommendations: [],
    };

    // Check if we have input from a resumed workflow
    const reviewInput = {
      approvedProducts: context.inputData?.approvedProducts || [],
      customerNote: context.inputData?.customerNote,
      offerDiscount: context.inputData?.offerDiscount,
    };

    // If we don't have agent input yet, suspend for human review
    if (!reviewInput.approvedProducts.length) {
      console.log(`Generating recommendations for customer: ${customerName}`);
      await suspend({
        customerName,
        recommendations,
        message:
          "Please review these product recommendations before sending to the customer",
      });

      // Placeholder return (won't be reached due to suspend)
      return {
        finalRecommendations: [],
        customerNote: "",
        offerDiscount: false,
      };
    }

    // Process the agent's product selections
    const finalRecommendations = recommendations
      .filter((product) =>
        reviewInput.approvedProducts.includes(product.productId),
      )
      .map((product) => ({
        productId: product.productId,
        productName: product.productName,
        price: product.price,
      }));

    return {
      finalRecommendations,
      customerNote: reviewInput.customerNote || "",
      offerDiscount: reviewInput.offerDiscount || false,
    };
  },
});
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Step 3: Send the recommendations to the customer
const sendRecommendations = new LegacyStep({
  id: "sendRecommendations",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    emailSent: z.boolean(),
    emailContent: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const { customerName } = context.getStepResult(generateRecommendations) || {
      customerName: "",
    };
    const { finalRecommendations, customerNote, offerDiscount } =
      context.getStepResult(reviewRecommendations) || {
        finalRecommendations: [],
        customerNote: "",
        offerDiscount: false,
      };

    // Generate email content based on the recommendations
    let emailContent = `Dear ${customerName},\n\nBased on your preferences, we recommend:\n\n`;

    finalRecommendations.forEach((product) => {
      emailContent += `- ${product.productName}: $${product.price.toFixed(2)}\n`;
    });

    if (offerDiscount) {
      emailContent +=
        "\nAs a valued customer, use code SAVE10 for 10% off your next purchase!\n";
    }

    if (customerNote) {
      emailContent += `\nPersonal note: ${customerNote}\n`;
    }

    emailContent += "\nThank you for your business,\nThe Sales Team";

    // In a real application, you would send this email
    console.log("Email content generated:", emailContent);

    return {
      emailSent: true,
      emailContent,
    };
  },
});

// Build the workflow
const recommendationWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "product-recommendation-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    customerName: z.string(),
  }),
});

recommendationWorkflow
  .step(generateRecommendations)
  .then(reviewRecommendations)
  .then(sendRecommendations)
  .commit();

// Register the workflow
const mastra = new Mastra({

```

```ts showLineNumbers copy

  const run = registeredWorkflow.createRun();

  console.log("Starting product recommendation workflow...");
  const result = await run.start({

## Advanced Example with Multiple User Inputs

This example demonstrates a more complex workflow that requires multiple human intervention points, such as in a content moderation system.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";
import { select, input } from "@inquirer/prompts";

// Step 1: Receive and analyze content
const analyzeContent = new LegacyStep({
  id: "analyzeContent",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    content: z.string(),
    aiAnalysisScore: z.number(),
    flaggedCategories: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const content = context.triggerData.content;

    // Simulate AI analysis
    const aiAnalysisScore = simulateContentAnalysis(content);
    const flaggedCategories =
      aiAnalysisScore < 0.7
        ? ["potentially inappropriate", "needs review"]
        : [];

    return {
      content,
      aiAnalysisScore,
      flaggedCategories,
    };
  },
});
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Step 2: Moderate content that needs review
const moderateContent = new LegacyStep({
  id: "moderateContent",
  // Define the schema for human input that will be provided when resuming
  inputSchema: z.object({
    moderatorDecision: z.enum(["approve", "reject", "modify"]).optional(),
    moderatorNotes: z.string().optional(),
    modifiedContent: z.string().optional(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    moderationResult: z.enum(["approved", "rejected", "modified"]),
    moderatedContent: z.string(),
    notes: z.string().optional(),

  // @ts-ignore
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    const analysisResult = context.getStepResult(analyzeContent);
    // Access the input provided when resuming the workflow
    const moderatorInput = {
      decision: context.inputData?.moderatorDecision,
      notes: context.inputData?.moderatorNotes,
      modifiedContent: context.inputData?.modifiedContent,
    };

    // If the AI analysis score is high enough, auto-approve
    if (

      });

      // Placeholder return
      return {
        moderationResult: "approved",
        moderatedContent: "",
      };
    }

    // Process the moderator's decision
    switch (moderatorInput.decision) {

    let modifiedContent = "";

    moderatorNotes = await input({
      message: "Enter any notes about your decision:",
    });

    if (moderatorDecision === "modify") {
      modifiedContent = await input({
        message: "Enter the modified content:",
        default: content,
      });
    }

    console.log("\nSubmitting your moderation decision...");

    // Resume the workflow with the moderator's input
    const resumeResult = await run.resume({
      stepId: "moderateContent",
      context: {
        moderatorDecision,
        moderatorNotes,
        modifiedContent,
      },
    });

    if (resumeResult?.results?.applyModeration?.status === "success") {
      console.log("\n===================================");
      console.log(
        `Moderation complete: ${resumeResult?.results?.applyModeration?.output.finalStatus}`,
      );
      console.log("===================================\n");

      if (resumeResult?.results?.applyModeration?.output.content) {
        console.log("Published content:");
        console.log(resumeResult.results.applyModeration.output.content);
      }
    }

    return resumeResult;
  }

  console.log(
    "Workflow completed without requiring human intervention:",
    result.results,
  );
  return result;
}

// Helper function for AI content analysis simulation
function simulateContentAnalysis(content: string): number {
  // In a real application, this would call an AI service
  // For the example, we're returning a random score
  return Math.random();
}

// Invoke the demo function
runModerationDemo().catch(console.error);
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Suspension Points** - Use the `suspend()` function within a step's execute to pause workflow execution.

2. **Suspension Payload** - Pass relevant data when suspending to provide context for human decision-making:

```ts
await suspend({
  messageForHuman: "Please review this data",
  data: someImportantData,
});
```

3. **Checking Workflow Status** - After starting a workflow, check the returned status to see if it's suspended:

```ts
const result = await workflow.start({ triggerData });
if (result.status === "suspended" && result.suspendedStepId === "stepId") {
  // Process suspension
  console.log("Workflow is waiting for input:", result.suspendPayload);
}
```

4. **Interactive Terminal Input** - Use libraries like Inquirer to create interactive prompts:

```ts
import { select, input, confirm } from "@inquirer/prompts";

// When the workflow is suspended
if (result.status === "suspended") {
  // Display information from the suspend payload
  console.log(result.suspendPayload.message);

  // Collect user input interactively
  const decision = await select({
    message: "What would you like to do?",
    choices: [
      { name: "Approve", value: "approve" },
      { name: "Reject", value: "reject" },
    ],
  });

  // Resume the workflow with the collected input
  await run.resume({
    stepId: result.suspendedStepId,
    context: { decision },
  });
}
```

5. **Resuming Workflow** - Use the `resume()` method to continue workflow execution with human input:

```ts
const resumeResult = await run.resume({
  stepId: "suspendedStepId",
  context: {
    // This data is passed to the suspended step as context.inputData
    // and must conform to the step's inputSchema
    userDecision: "approve",
  },
});
```

6. **Input Schema for Human Data** - Define an input schema on steps that might be resumed with human input to ensure type safety:

```ts
const myStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "myStep",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    // This schema validates the data passed in resume's context
    // and makes it available as context.inputData
    userDecision: z.enum(["approve", "reject"]),
    userComments: z.string().optional(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    // Check if we have user input from a previous suspension
    if (context.inputData?.userDecision) {
      // Process the user's decision
      return { result: `User decided: ${context.inputData.userDecision}` };
    }

    // If no input, suspend for human decision
    await suspend();
  },
});
```

Human-in-the-loop workflows are powerful for building systems that blend automation with human judgment, such as:

- Content moderation systems
- Approval workflows
- Supervised AI systems
- Customer service automation with escalation

# Parallel Execution with Steps
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/parallel-steps

When building AI applications, you often need to process multiple independent tasks simultaneously to improve efficiency.

## Control Flow Diagram

This example shows how to structure a workflow that executes steps in parallel, with each branch handling its own data flow and dependencies.

Here's the control flow diagram:

<img
  src="/parallel-chains.png"
  alt="Diagram showing workflow with parallel steps"
  width={600}
/>

## Creating the Steps

Let's start by creating the steps and initializing the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const stepOne = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepOne",
  execute: async ({ context }) => ({
    doubledValue: context.triggerData.inputValue * 2,
  }),
});

const stepTwo = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepTwo",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    if (context.steps.stepOne.status !== "success") {
      return { incrementedValue: 0 };
    }

    return { incrementedValue: context.steps.stepOne.output.doubledValue + 1 };
  },
});

const stepThree = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepThree",
  execute: async ({ context }) => ({
    tripledValue: context.triggerData.inputValue * 3,
  }),
});

const stepFour = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepFour",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    if (context.steps.stepThree.status !== "success") {
      return { isEven: false };
    }

    return { isEven: context.steps.stepThree.output.tripledValue % 2 === 0 };
  },
});

const myWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputValue: z.number(),
  }),
});
```

## Chaining and Parallelizing Steps

Now we can add the steps to the workflow. Note the `.then()` method is used to chain the steps, but the `.step()` method is used to add the steps to the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
myWorkflow
  .step(stepOne)
  .then(stepTwo) // chain one
  .step(stepThree)
  .then(stepFour) // chain two
  .commit();

const { start } = myWorkflow.createRun();

const result = await start({ triggerData: { inputValue: 3 } });
```

# Workflow (Legacy) with Sequential Steps
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/sequential-steps

Workflow can be chained to run one after another in a specific sequence.

## Control Flow Diagram

This example shows how to chain workflow steps by using the `then` method demonstrating how to pass data between sequential steps and execute them in order.

Here's the control flow diagram:

<img
  src="/sequential-chains.png"
  alt="Diagram showing workflow with sequential steps"
  width={600}
/>

## Creating the Steps

Let's start by creating the steps and initializing the workflow.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const stepOne = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepOne",
  execute: async ({ context }) => ({
    doubledValue: context.triggerData.inputValue * 2,
  }),
});

const stepTwo = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepTwo",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    if (context.steps.stepOne.status !== "success") {
      return { incrementedValue: 0 };
    }

    return { incrementedValue: context.steps.stepOne.output.doubledValue + 1 };
  },
});

const stepThree = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepThree",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    if (context.steps.stepTwo.status !== "success") {
      return { tripledValue: 0 };
    }

    return { tripledValue: context.steps.stepTwo.output.incrementedValue * 3 };
  },
});

// Build the workflow
const myWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputValue: z.number(),
  }),
});
```

## Chaining the Steps and Executing the Workflow

Now let's chain the steps together.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// sequential steps
myWorkflow.step(stepOne).then(stepTwo).then(stepThree);

myWorkflow.commit();

const { start } = myWorkflow.createRun();

const res = await start({ triggerData: { inputValue: 90 } });
```

# Workflow (Legacy) with Suspend and Resume
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/suspend-and-resume

Workflow steps can be suspended and resumed at any point in the workflow execution. This example demonstrates how to suspend a workflow step and resume it later.

## Basic Example

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const stepOne = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepOne",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    doubledValue: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const doubledValue = context.triggerData.inputValue * 2;
    return { doubledValue };
  },
});
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const stepTwo = new LegacyStep({
  id: "stepTwo",
  outputSchema: z.object({
    incrementedValue: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    const secondValue = context.inputData?.secondValue ?? 0;
    const doubledValue = context.getStepResult(stepOne)?.doubledValue ?? 0;

    const incrementedValue = doubledValue + secondValue;

    if (incrementedValue < 100) {
      await suspend();
      return { incrementedValue: 0 };
    }
    return { incrementedValue };
  },
});

// Build the workflow
const myWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    inputValue: z.number(),
  }),
});

// run workflows in parallel
myWorkflow.step(stepOne).then(stepTwo).commit();
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Register the workflow
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { registeredWorkflow: myWorkflow },
});

// Get registered workflow from Mastra
const registeredWorkflow = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("registeredWorkflow");
const { runId, start } = registeredWorkflow.createRun();

// Start watching the workflow before executing it
myWorkflow.watch(async ({ context, activePaths }) => {
  for (const _path of activePaths) {
    const stepTwoStatus = context.steps?.stepTwo?.status;
    if (stepTwoStatus === "suspended") {
      console.log("Workflow suspended, resuming with new value");

      // Resume the workflow with new context
      await myWorkflow.resume({
        runId,
        stepId: "stepTwo",
        context: { secondValue: 100 },
      });
    }
  }
});

// Start the workflow execution
await start({ triggerData: { inputValue: 45 } });
```

## Advanced Example with Multiple Suspension Points Using async/await pattern and suspend payloads

This example demonstrates a more complex workflow with multiple suspension points using the async/await pattern. It simulates a content generation workflow that requires human intervention at different stages.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Step 1: Get user input
const getUserInput = new LegacyStep({
  id: "getUserInput",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // In a real application, this might come from a form or API
    return { userInput: context.triggerData.input };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({ userInput: z.string() }),
});
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Step 2: Generate content with AI (may suspend for human guidance)
const promptAgent = new LegacyStep({
  id: "promptAgent",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    guidance: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    const userInput = context.getStepResult(getUserInput)?.userInput;
    console.log(`Generating content based on: ${userInput}`);

    const guidance = context.inputData?.guidance;

    // Simulate AI generating content
    const initialDraft = generateInitialDraft(userInput);

    // If confidence is high, return the generated content directly
    if (initialDraft.confidenceScore > 0.7) {
      return { modelOutput: initialDraft.content };
    }

    console.log(
      "Low confidence in generated content, suspending for human guidance",
      { guidance },
    );

    // If confidence is low, suspend for human guidance
    if (!guidance) {
      // only suspend if no guidance is provided
      await suspend();
      return undefined;
    }

    // This code runs after resume with human guidance
    console.log("Resumed with human guidance");

    // Use the human guidance to improve the output
    return {
      modelOutput: enhanceWithGuidance(initialDraft.content, guidance),
    };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({ modelOutput: z.string() }).optional(),
});
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Step 3: Evaluate the content quality
const evaluateTone = new LegacyStep({
  id: "evaluateToneConsistency",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const content = context.getStepResult(promptAgent)?.modelOutput;

    // Simulate evaluation
    return {
      toneScore: { score: calculateToneScore(content) },
      completenessScore: { score: calculateCompletenessScore(content) },
    };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({
    toneScore: z.any(),
    completenessScore: z.any(),
  }),
});
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Step 4: Improve response if needed (may suspend)
const improveResponse = new LegacyStep({
  id: "improveResponse",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    improvedContent: z.string(),
    resumeAttempts: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    const content = context.getStepResult(promptAgent)?.modelOutput;
    const toneScore = context.getStepResult(evaluateTone)?.toneScore.score ?? 0;
    const completenessScore =
      context.getStepResult(evaluateTone)?.completenessScore.score ?? 0;

    const improvedContent = context.inputData.improvedContent;
    const resumeAttempts = context.inputData.resumeAttempts ?? 0;

    // If scores are above threshold, make minor improvements
    if (toneScore > 0.8 && completenessScore > 0.8) {
      return { improvedOutput: makeMinorImprovements(content) };
    }

    console.log(
      "Content quality below threshold, suspending for human intervention",
      { improvedContent, resumeAttempts },
    );

    if (!improvedContent) {
      // Suspend with payload containing content and resume attempts
      await suspend({
        content,
        scores: { tone: toneScore, completeness: completenessScore },
        needsImprovement: toneScore < 0.8 ? "tone" : "completeness",
        resumeAttempts: resumeAttempts + 1,
      });
      return { improvedOutput: content ?? "" };
    }

    console.log("Resumed with human improvements", improvedContent);
    return { improvedOutput: improvedContent ?? content ?? "" };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({ improvedOutput: z.string() }).optional(),
});
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Step 5: Final evaluation
const evaluateImproved = new LegacyStep({
  id: "evaluateImprovedResponse",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const improvedContent =
      context.getStepResult(improveResponse)?.improvedOutput;

    // Simulate final evaluation
    return {
      toneScore: { score: calculateToneScore(improvedContent) },
      completenessScore: { score: calculateCompletenessScore(improvedContent) },
    };
  },
  outputSchema: z.object({
    toneScore: z.any(),
    completenessScore: z.any(),
  }),
});

// Build the workflow
const contentWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "content-generation-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({ input: z.string() }),
});

contentWorkflow
  .step(getUserInput)
  .then(promptAgent)
  .then(evaluateTone)
  .then(improveResponse)
  .then(evaluateImproved)
  .commit();
```

```ts showLineNumbers copy
// Register the workflow
const mastra = new Mastra({
  legacy_workflows: { contentWorkflow },
});

// Helper functions (simulated)
function generateInitialDraft(input: string = "") {
  // Simulate AI generating content
  return {
    content: `Generated content based on: ${input}`,
    confidenceScore: 0.6, // Simulate low confidence to trigger suspension
  };
}

function enhanceWithGuidance(content: string = "", guidance: string = "") {
  return `${content} (Enhanced with guidance: ${guidance})`;
}

function makeMinorImprovements(content: string = "") {
  return `${content} (with minor improvements)`;
}

function calculateToneScore(_: string = "") {
  return 0.7; // Simulate a score that will trigger suspension
}

function calculateCompletenessScore(_: string = "") {
  return 0.9;
}

// Usage example
async function runWorkflow() {
  const workflow = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("contentWorkflow");
  const { runId, start } = workflow.createRun();

  let finalResult: any;

  // Start the workflow
  const initialResult = await start({

  // Check if promptAgent step is suspended
  if (promptAgentStepResult?.status === "suspended") {

    console.log("Suspension payload:", promptAgentStepResult?.suspendPayload);

    // Resume with human guidance
    const resumeResult1 = await workflow.resume({

# Tool as a Workflow step (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/using-a-tool-as-a-step

This example demonstrates how to create and integrate a custom tool as a workflow step, showing how to define input/output schemas and implement the tool's execution logic.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const crawlWebpage = createTool({
  id: "Crawl Webpage",
  description: "Crawls a webpage and extracts the text content",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    url: z.string().url(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({

  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {

# Data Mapping with Workflow Variables (Legacy)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/examples/workflows_legacy/workflow-variables

This example demonstrates how to use workflow variables to map data between steps in a Mastra workflow.

## Use Case: User Registration Process

In this example, we'll build a simple user registration workflow that:

1. Validates user input
1. Formats the user data
1. Creates a user profile

## Implementation

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/workflows/user-registration.ts" copy
import { LegacyStep, LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define our schemas for better type safety
const userInputSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number().min(18),
});

const validatedDataSchema = z.object({
  isValid: z.boolean(),
  validatedData: z.object({
    email: z.string(),
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number(),
  }),
});

const formattedDataSchema = z.object({
  userId: z.string(),
  formattedData: z.object({
    email: z.string(),
    displayName: z.string(),
    ageGroup: z.string(),
  }),
});

const profileSchema = z.object({
  profile: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    email: z.string(),
    displayName: z.string(),
    ageGroup: z.string(),
    createdAt: z.string(),
  }),
});

// Define the workflow
const registrationWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "user-registration",
  triggerSchema: userInputSchema,
});

// Step 1: Validate user input
const validateInput = new LegacyStep({
  id: "validateInput",
  inputSchema: userInputSchema,
  outputSchema: validatedDataSchema,
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const { email, name, age } = context;

    // Simple validation logic
    const isValid = email.includes("@") && name.length > 0 && age >= 18;

    return {
      isValid,
      validatedData: {
        email: email.toLowerCase().trim(),
        name,
        age,
      },
    };
  },
});

// Step 2: Format user data
const formatUserData = new LegacyStep({
  id: "formatUserData",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    validatedData: z.object({
      email: z.string(),
      name: z.string(),
      age: z.number(),
    }),
  }),
  outputSchema: formattedDataSchema,
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const { validatedData } = context;

    // Generate a simple user ID
    const userId = `user_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)}`;

    // Format the data
    const ageGroup = validatedData.age < 30 ? "young-adult" : "adult";

    return {
      userId,
      formattedData: {
        email: validatedData.email,
        displayName: validatedData.name,
        ageGroup,
      },
    };
  },
});

// Step 3: Create user profile
const createUserProfile = new LegacyStep({
  id: "createUserProfile",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    formattedData: z.object({
      email: z.string(),
      displayName: z.string(),
      ageGroup: z.string(),
    }),
  }),
  outputSchema: profileSchema,
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const { userId, formattedData } = context;

    // In a real app, you would save to a database here

    return {
      profile: {
        id: userId,
        ...formattedData,
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      },
    };
  },
});

// Build the workflow with variable mappings
registrationWorkflow
  // First step gets data from the trigger
  .step(validateInput, {
    variables: {
      email: { step: "trigger", path: "email" },
      name: { step: "trigger", path: "name" },
      age: { step: "trigger", path: "age" },
    },
  })
  // Format user data with validated data from previous step
  .then(formatUserData, {
    variables: {
      validatedData: { step: validateInput, path: "validatedData" },
    },
    when: {
      ref: { step: validateInput, path: "isValid" },
      query: { $eq: true },
    },
  })
  // Create profile with data from the format step
  .then(createUserProfile, {
    variables: {
      userId: { step: formatUserData, path: "userId" },
      formattedData: { step: formatUserData, path: "formattedData" },
    },
  })
  .commit();

export default registrationWorkflow;
```

## How to Use This Example

1. Create the file as shown above
2. Register the workflow in your Mastra instance
3. Execute the workflow:

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:5000/api/workflows/user-registration/start-async' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "name": "John Doe",
       "age": 25
     }'
```

## Key Takeaways

This example demonstrates several important concepts about workflow variables:

1. **Data Mapping**: Variables map data from one step to another, creating a clear data flow.

2. **Path Access**: The `path` property specifies which part of a step's output to use.

3. **Conditional Execution**: The `when` property allows steps to execute conditionally based on previous step outputs.

4. **Type Safety**: Each step defines input and output schemas for type safety, ensuring that the data passed between steps is properly typed.

5. **Explicit Data Dependencies**: By defining input schemas and using variable mappings, the data dependencies between steps are made explicit and clear.

For more information on workflow variables, see the [Workflow Variables documentation](../../docs/workflows-legacy/variables.mdx).

description: Guide on building a recruiter workflow in Mastra to gather and process candidate information using LLMs.
---

# Introduction
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/guides/guide/ai-recruiter

In this guide, you'll learn how Mastra helps you build workflows with LLMs.

We'll walk through creating a workflow that gathers information from a candidate's resume, then branches to either a technical or behavioral question based on the candidate's profile. Along the way, you'll see how to structure workflow steps, handle branching, and integrate LLM calls.

Below is a concise version of the workflow. It starts by importing the necessary modules, sets up Mastra, defines steps to extract and classify candidate data, and then asks suitable follow-up questions. Each code block is followed by a short explanation of what it does and why it's useful.

## 1. Imports and Setup

You need to import Mastra tools and Zod to handle workflow definitions and data validation.

```ts filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { createStep, createWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";
```

Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the `.env` file.

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-key>
```

## 2. Step One: Gather Candidate Info

You want to extract candidate details from the resume text and classify them as technical or non-technical. This step calls an LLM to parse the resume and return structured JSON, including the name, technical status, specialty, and the original resume text. The code reads resumeText from trigger data, prompts the LLM, and returns organized fields for use in subsequent steps.

```ts filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const recruiter = new Agent({
  name: "Recruiter Agent",
  instructions: `You are a recruiter.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

const gatherCandidateInfo = createStep({
  id: "gatherCandidateInfo",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    resumeText: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    candidateName: z.string(),
    isTechnical: z.boolean(),
    specialty: z.string(),
    resumeText: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const resumeText = inputData?.resumeText;

    const prompt = `
          Extract details from the resume text:
          "${resumeText}"
        `;

    const res = await recruiter.generate(prompt, {
      output: z.object({
        candidateName: z.string(),
        isTechnical: z.boolean(),
        specialty: z.string(),
        resumeText: z.string(),
      }),
    });

    return res.object;
  },
});
```

## 3. Technical Question Step

This step prompts a candidate who is identified as technical for more information about how they got into their specialty. It uses the entire resume text so the LLM can craft a relevant follow-up question. The code generates a question about the candidate's specialty.

```ts filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
interface CandidateInfo {
  candidateName: string;
  isTechnical: boolean;
  specialty: string;
  resumeText: string;
}

const askAboutSpecialty = createStep({
  id: "askAboutSpecialty",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    candidateName: z.string(),
    isTechnical: z.boolean(),
    specialty: z.string(),
    resumeText: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    question: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const candidateInfo = inputData;

    const prompt = `
          You are a recruiter. Given the resume below, craft a short question
          for ${candidateInfo?.candidateName} about how they got into "${candidateInfo?.specialty}".
          Resume: ${candidateInfo?.resumeText}
        `;
    const res = await recruiter.generate(prompt);

    return { question: res?.text?.trim() || "" };
  },
});
```

## 4. Behavioral Question Step

If the candidate is non-technical, you want a different follow-up question. This step asks what interests them most about the role, again referencing their complete resume text. The code solicits a role-focused query from the LLM.

```ts filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const askAboutRole = createStep({
  id: "askAboutRole",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    candidateName: z.string(),
    isTechnical: z.boolean(),
    specialty: z.string(),
    resumeText: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    question: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const candidateInfo = inputData;

    const prompt = `
          You are a recruiter. Given the resume below, craft a short question
          for ${candidateInfo?.candidateName} asking what interests them most about this role.
          Resume: ${candidateInfo?.resumeText}
        `;
    const res = await recruiter.generate(prompt);
    return { question: res?.text?.trim() || "" };
  },
});
```

## 5. Define the Workflow

You now combine the steps to implement branching logic based on the candidate's technical status. The workflow first gathers candidate data, then either asks about their specialty or about their role, depending on isTechnical. The code chains gatherCandidateInfo with askAboutSpecialty and askAboutRole, and commits the workflow.

```ts filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const candidateWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "candidate-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    resumeText: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    question: z.string(),
  }),
});

candidateWorkflow.then(gatherCandidateInfo).branch([
  // Branch for technical candidates
  [
    async ({ inputData }) => {
      return inputData?.isTechnical;
    },
    askAboutSpecialty,
  ],
  // Branch for non-technical candidates
  [
    async ({ inputData }) => {
      return !inputData?.isTechnical;
    },
    askAboutRole,
  ],
]);

candidateWorkflow.commit();
```

## 6. Execute the Workflow

```ts filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    candidateWorkflow,
  },
});

(async () => {
  const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("candidateWorkflow").createRunAsync();

  console.log("Run", run.runId);

  const runResult = await run.start({
    inputData: { resumeText: "Simulated resume content..." },
  });

  console.log("Final output:", runResult);
})();
```

You've just built a workflow to parse a resume and decide which question to ask based on the candidate's technical abilities. Congrats and happy hacking!

# Agents Guide: Building a Chef Assistant
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/guides/guide/chef-michel

In this guide, we'll walk through creating a "Chef Assistant" agent that helps users cook meals with available ingredients.

<YouTube id="_tZhOqHCrF0" />

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Mastra installed: `npm install @mastra/core@latest`

---

## Create the Agent

<Steps>
### Define the Agent

Create a new file `src/mastra/agents/chefAgent.ts` and define your agent:

```ts copy filename="src/mastra/agents/chefAgent.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

export const chefAgent = new Agent({
  name: "chef-agent",
  instructions:
    "You are Michel, a practical and experienced home chef" +
    "You help people cook with whatever ingredients they have available.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});
```

---

## Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

---

## Register the Agent with Mastra

In your main file, register the agent:

```ts copy filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

import { chefAgent } from "./agents/chefAgent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { chefAgent },
});
```

---

</Steps >

## Interacting with the Agent

<Steps>
### Generating Text Responses

```ts copy filename="src/index.ts"
async function main() {
  const query =
    "In my kitchen I have: pasta, canned tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and some dried herbs (basil and oregano). What can I make?";
  console.log(`Query: ${query}`);

  const response = await chefAgent.generate([{ role: "user", content: query }]);
  console.log("\n👨‍🍳 Chef Michel:", response.text);
}

main();
```

Run the script:

```bash copy
npx bun src/index.ts
```

Output:

```
Query: In my kitchen I have: pasta, canned tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and some dried herbs (basil and oregano). What can I make?

👨‍🍳 Chef Michel: You can make a delicious pasta al pomodoro! Here's how...
```

---

### Streaming Responses

```ts copy filename="src/index.ts"
async function main() {
  const query =
    "Now I'm over at my friend's house, and they have: chicken thighs, coconut milk, sweet potatoes, and some curry powder.";
  console.log(`Query: ${query}`);

  const stream = await chefAgent.stream([{ role: "user", content: query }]);

  console.log("\n Chef Michel: ");

  for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk);
  }

  console.log("\n\n✅ Recipe complete!");
}

main();
```

Output:

```
Query: Now I'm over at my friend's house, and they have: chicken thighs, coconut milk, sweet potatoes, and some curry powder.

👨‍🍳 Chef Michel:
Great! You can make a comforting chicken curry...

✅ Recipe complete!
```

---

### Generating a Recipe with Structured Data

```ts copy filename="src/index.ts"
import { z } from "zod";

async function main() {
  const query =
    "I want to make lasagna, can you generate a lasagna recipe for me?";
  console.log(`Query: ${query}`);

  // Define the Zod schema
  const schema = z.object({
    ingredients: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        amount: z.string(),
      }),
    ),
    steps: z.array(z.string()),
  });

  const response = await chefAgent.generate(
    [{ role: "user", content: query }],
    { output: schema },
  );
  console.log("\n👨‍🍳 Chef Michel:", response.object);
}

main();
```

Output:

```
Query: I want to make lasagna, can you generate a lasagna recipe for me?

👨‍🍳 Chef Michel: {
  ingredients: [
    { name: "Lasagna noodles", amount: "12 sheets" },
    { name: "Ground beef", amount: "1 pound" },
    // ...
  ],
  steps: [
    "Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).",
    "Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions.",
    // ...
  ]
}
```

---

</Steps >

## Running the Agent Server

<Steps>

### Using `mastra dev`

You can run your agent as a service using the `mastra dev` command:

```bash copy
mastra dev
```

This will start a server exposing endpoints to interact with your registered agents.

### Accessing the Chef Assistant API

By default, `mastra dev` runs on `http://localhost:5000`. Your Chef Assistant agent will be available at:

```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/agents/chefAgent/generate
```

### Interacting with the Agent via `curl`

You can interact with the agent using `curl` from the command line:

```bash copy
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/agents/chefAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I have eggs, flour, and milk. What can I make?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "text": "You can make delicious pancakes! Here's a simple recipe..."
}
```

</Steps>

title: "MCP Server: Building a Notes MCP Server | Mastra Guide"
description: "A step-by-step guide to creating a fully-featured MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for managing notes using the Mastra framework."
---

import { FileTree, Steps } from "nextra/components";

# MCP Server Guide: Building a Notes MCP Server
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/guides/guide/notes-mcp-server

In this guide, you'll learn how to build a complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) server from scratch. This server will manage a collection of markdown notes, exposing tools to create and read them, and providing intelligent prompts to assist with note-taking.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- A basic understanding of TypeScript

---

## The Plan

We will build a `notes` server that can:
1.  **List and Read Notes**: Allow clients to browse and view markdown files stored on the server.
2.  **Write Notes**: Provide a tool for creating or updating notes.
3.  **Offer Smart Prompts**: Generate contextual prompts, like creating a daily note template or summarizing existing content.

<Steps>
## Initialize a Mastra Project

First, create a new Mastra project using the `create-mastra` CLI.

```bash copy
npx create-mastra@latest
```

Follow the prompts. When it's done, navigate into your new project directory.

```bash copy
cd "<your-project-name>"
```

The default scaffold includes agent, tools and workflow examples. Since we're focusing on an MCP server, let's clean up the project.

```bash copy
rm -rf src/mastra/agents src/mastra/workflows src/mastra/tools/weather-tool.ts
```

Let's also remove the components from those files that were registered in the Mastra instance at `src/mastra/index.ts`.
Our file should now look like this:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" {1-14}
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core/mastra';
import { PinoLogger } from '@mastra/loggers';
import { LibSQLStore } from '@mastra/libsql';

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    // stores telemetry, evals, ... into memory storage, if it needs to persist, change to file:../mastra.db
    url: ":memory:",
  }),
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: 'Mastra',
    level: 'info',
  }),
});
```


## Set Up the Directory Structure

Create a dedicated directory for your MCP server's logic and a `notes` directory for your notes:

```bash copy
mkdir notes src/mastra/mcp
```

Create the following files:

```bash copy
touch src/mastra/mcp/{server,resources,prompts}.ts
```
- `server.ts`: Will contain the main MCP server configuration.
- `resources.ts`: Will handle listing and reading note files.
- `prompts.ts`: Will contain the logic for our smart prompts.

The resulting directory structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="<your-project-name>" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="notes" defaultOpen />
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="mcp" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="server.ts" />
          <FileTree.File name="resources.ts" />
          <FileTree.File name="prompts.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="tools" defaultOpen />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Create and Register the MCP Server

Before we proceed, we need to install the `@mastra/mcp` package.

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/mcp
```

Now, let's define the MCP server instance in `src/mastra/mcp/server.ts`:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/mcp/server.ts" {1-7}
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";

export const notes = new MCPServer({
    name: "notes",
    version: "0.1.0",
    // we will add more configuration here later
});
```

Now register this MCP server in your Mastra instance at `src/mastra/index.ts`. The key `notes` is the public identifier for your MCP server:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" {4,15-17}
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PinoLogger } from '@mastra/loggers';
import { LibSQLStore } from '@mastra/libsql';
import { notes } from "./mcp/server";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    // stores telemetry, evals, ... into memory storage, if it needs to persist, change to file:../mastra.db
    url: ":memory:",
  }),
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: 'Mastra',
    level: 'info',
  }),
  mcpServers: {
    notes,
  },
})
```

## Implement and Register Resource Handlers

Resource handlers allow clients to discover and read the content your server manages.
Let's implement handlers in `src/mastra/mcp/resources.ts` to work with markdown files in the `notes` directory:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/mcp/resources.ts" {1-51}
import fs from "fs/promises";
import path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import type { MCPServerResources, Resource } from "@mastra/mcp";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
const NOTES_DIR = path.resolve(__dirname, "../../notes"); // relative to the default output directory

const listNoteFiles = async (): Promise<Resource[]> => {
  try {
    await fs.mkdir(NOTES_DIR, { recursive: true });
    const files = await fs.readdir(NOTES_DIR);
    return files
      .filter(file => file.endsWith('.md'))
      .map(file => {
        const title = file.replace(".md", "");
        return {
          uri: `notes://${title}`,
          name: title,
          description: `A note about ${title}`,
          mime_type: "text/markdown",
        };
      });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error listing note resources:", error);
    return [];
  }
};

const readNoteFile = async (uri: string): Promise<string | null> => {
  const title = uri.replace("notes://", "");
  const notePath = path.join(NOTES_DIR, `${title}.md`);
  try {
    return await fs.readFile(notePath, "utf-8");
  } catch (error) {
    if ((error as NodeJS.ErrnoException).code !== 'ENOENT') {
      console.error(`Error reading resource ${uri}:`, error);
    }
    return null;
  }
};

export const resourceHandlers: MCPServerResources = {
  listResources: listNoteFiles,
  getResourceContent: async ({ uri }: { uri: string }) => {
    const content = await readNoteFile(uri);
    if (content === null) return { text: "" };
    return { text: content };
  },
};
```

Now register these resource handlers in `src/mastra/mcp/server.ts`:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/mcp/server.ts" {2,7}
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { resourceHandlers } from "./resources";

export const notes = new MCPServer({
    name: "notes",
    version: "0.1.0",
    resources: resourceHandlers,
});
```

## Implement and Register a Tool

Tools are the actions your server can perform. Let's create a `write` tool.
First, define the tool in `src/mastra/tools/write-note.ts`:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/tools/write-note.ts" {1-30}
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";
import path from "node:path";
import fs from "fs/promises";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
const NOTES_DIR = path.resolve(__dirname, "../../notes");

export const writeNoteTool = createTool({
  id: "write",
  description: "Write a new note or overwrite an existing one.",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    title: z.string().nonempty().describe("The title of the note. This will be the filename."),
    content: z.string().nonempty().describe("The markdown content of the note."),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.string().nonempty(),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    try {
      const { title, content } = context;
      const filePath = path.join(NOTES_DIR, `${title}.md`);
      await fs.mkdir(NOTES_DIR, { recursive: true });
      await fs.writeFile(filePath, content, "utf-8");
      return `Successfully wrote to note \"${title}\".`;
    } catch (error: any) {
      return `Error writing note: ${error.message}`;
    }
  },
});
```

Now register this tool in `src/mastra/mcp/server.ts`:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/mcp/server.ts" {3,9-11}
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { resourceHandlers } from "./resources";
import { writeNoteTool } from "../tools/write-note";

export const notes = new MCPServer({
    name: "notes",
    version: "0.1.0",
    resources: resourceHandlers,
    tools: {
      write: writeNoteTool,
    },
});
```

## Implement and Register Prompts

Prompt handlers provide ready-to-use prompts for clients. Let's implement three: one for a daily note, one to summarize a note, and one to brainstorm ideas. This requires a few markdown-parsing libraries.

```bash copy
npm i unified remark-parse gray-matter @types/unist
```

Now let's implement the prompts in `src/mastra/mcp/prompts.ts`:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/mcp/prompts.ts" {1-61}
import type { MCPServerPrompts } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { unified } from 'unified';
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse';
import matter from 'gray-matter';
import type { Node } from 'unist';

const prompts = [
  { name: "new_daily_note", description: "Create a new daily note.", version: "1.0.0" },
  { name: "summarize_note", description: "Give me a TL;DR of the note.", version: "1.0.0" },
  { name: "brainstorm_ideas", description: "Brainstorm new ideas based on a note.", version: "1.0.0" }
];

function stringifyNode(node: Node): string {
  if ('value' in node && typeof node.value === 'string') return node.value;
  if ('children' in node && Array.isArray(node.children)) return node.children.map(stringifyNode).join('');
  return '';
}

export async function analyzeMarkdown(md: string) {
  const { content } = matter(md);
  const tree = unified().use(remarkParse).parse(content);
  const headings: string[] = [];
  const wordCounts: Record<string, number> = {};
  let currentHeading = 'untitled';
  wordCounts[currentHeading] = 0;
  tree.children.forEach((node) => {
    if (node.type === 'heading' && node.depth === 2) {
      currentHeading = stringifyNode(node);
      headings.push(currentHeading);
      wordCounts[currentHeading] = 0;
    } else {
      const textContent = stringifyNode(node);
      if (textContent.trim()) {
        wordCounts[currentHeading] = (wordCounts[currentHeading] || 0) + textContent.split(/\\s+/).length;
      }
    }
  });
  return { headings, wordCounts };
}

const getPromptMessages: MCPServerPrompts['getPromptMessages'] = async ({ name, args }) => {
  switch (name) {
    case "new_daily_note":
      const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
      return [{ role: "user", content: { type: "text", text: `Create a new note titled \"${today}\" with sections: \"## Tasks\", \"## Meetings\", \"## Notes\".` } }];
    case "summarize_note":
      if (!args?.noteContent) throw new Error("No content provided");
      const metaSum = await analyzeMarkdown(args.noteContent as string);
      return [{ role: "user", content: { type: "text", text: `Summarize each section in ≤ 3 bullets.\\n\\n### Outline\\n${metaSum.headings.map(h => `- ${h} (${metaSum.wordCounts[h] || 0} words)`).join("\\n")}`.trim() } }];
    case "brainstorm_ideas":
      if (!args?.noteContent) throw new Error("No content provided");
      const metaBrain = await analyzeMarkdown(args.noteContent as string);
      return [{ role: "user", content: { type: "text", text: `Brainstorm 3 ideas for underdeveloped sections below ${args?.topic ? `on ${args.topic}` : '.'}\\n\\nUnderdeveloped sections:\\n${metaBrain.headings.length ? metaBrain.headings.map(h => `- ${h}`).join("\\n") : "- (none, pick any)"}` } }];
    default: throw new Error(`Prompt \"${name}\" not found`);
  }
};

export const promptHandlers: MCPServerPrompts = {
  listPrompts: async () => prompts,
  getPromptMessages,
};
```

Now register these prompt handlers in `src/mastra/mcp/server.ts`:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/mcp/server.ts"  {4,10}
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { resourceHandlers } from "./resources";
import { writeNoteTool } from "../tools/write-note";
import { promptHandlers } from "./prompts";

export const notesServer = new MCPServer({
  name: "notes",
  version: "0.1.0",
  resources: resourceHandlers,
  prompts: promptHandlers,
  tools: {
    write: writeNoteTool,
  },
});
```

## Run the Server

We can now run the development server:

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

Navigate to the Mastra playground (typically at `http://localhost:5000`).
In the "MCP Servers" section, you'll find your `notes` server.
You can use the playground to:
- Get the endpoints for your MCP server.
- Get client configurations for MCP Clients like Cursor and Windsurf.
- See a list of and test the tools available to the MCP server.
</Steps>

## Next Steps

You can now use this MCP server with any MCP Client. For example, you can use it with Cursor or Windsurf to manage notes.

title: "Building a Research Paper Assistant | Mastra RAG Guides"
description: Guide on creating an AI research assistant that can analyze and answer questions about academic papers using RAG.

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

# Building a Research Paper Assistant with RAG
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/guides/guide/research-assistant

In this guide, we'll create an AI research assistant that can analyze academic papers and answer specific questions about their content using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

We'll use the foundational Transformer paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762) as our example.

## Understanding RAG Components

Let's understand how RAG works and how we'll implement each component:

1. Knowledge Store/Index

   - Converting text into vector representations
   - Creating numerical representations of content
   - Implementation: We'll use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small to create embeddings and store them in PgVector

2. Retriever

   - Finding relevant content via similarity search
   - Matching query embeddings with stored vectors
   - Implementation: We'll use PgVector to perform similarity searches on our stored embeddings

3. Generator
   - Processing retrieved content with an LLM
   - Creating contextually informed responses
   - Implementation: We'll use GPT-4o-mini to generate answers based on retrieved content

Our implementation will:

1. Process the Transformer paper into embeddings
2. Store them in PgVector for quick retrieval
3. Use similarity search to find relevant sections
4. Generate accurate responses using retrieved context

## Project Structure

```
research-assistant/
├── src/
│   ├── mastra/
│   │   ├── agents/
│   │   │   └── researchAgent.ts
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── store.ts
├── package.json
└── .env
```

<Steps>
### Initialize Project and Install Dependencies

First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir research-assistant
cd research-assistant
```

Initialize a new Node.js project and install the required dependencies:

```bash copy
npm init -y
npm install @mastra/core@latest @mastra/rag@latest @mastra/pg@latest @ai-sdk/openai@latest ai@latest zod@latest
```

Set up environment variables for API access and database connection:

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string
```

Create the necessary files for our project:

```bash copy
mkdir -p src/mastra/agents
touch src/mastra/agents/researchAgent.ts
touch src/mastra/index.ts src/store.ts src/index.ts
```

### Create the Research Assistant Agent

Now we'll create our RAG-enabled research assistant. The agent uses:

- A [Vector Query Tool](/reference/tools/vector-query-tool) for performing semantic search over our vector store to find relevant content in our papers.
- GPT-4o-mini for understanding queries and generating responses
- Custom instructions that guide the agent on how to analyze papers, use retrieved content effectively, and acknowledge limitations

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/researchAgent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { createVectorQueryTool } from "@mastra/rag";

// Create a tool for semantic search over our paper embeddings
const vectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pgVector",
  indexName: "papers",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});

export const researchAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Research Assistant",
  instructions: `You are a helpful research assistant that analyzes academic papers and technical documents.
    Use the provided vector query tool to find relevant information from your knowledge base, 
    and provide accurate, well-supported answers based on the retrieved content.
    Focus on the specific content available in the tool and acknowledge if you cannot find sufficient information to answer a question.
    Base your responses only on the content provided, not on general knowledge.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    vectorQueryTool,
  },
});
```

### Set Up the Mastra Instance and Vector Store

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";

import { researchAgent } from "./agents/researchAgent";

// Initialize Mastra instance
const pgVector = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { researchAgent },
  vectors: { pgVector },
});
```

### Load and Process the Paper

This step handles the initial document processing. We:

1. Fetch the research paper from its URL
2. Convert it into a document object
3. Split it into smaller, manageable chunks for better processing

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/store.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";
import { embedMany } from "ai";
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

// Load the paper
const paperUrl = "https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762";
const response = await fetch(paperUrl);
const paperText = await response.text();

// Create document and chunk it
const doc = MDocument.fromText(paperText);
const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "recursive",
  size: 512,
  overlap: 50,
  separator: "\n",
});

console.log("Number of chunks:", chunks.length);
// Number of chunks: 893
```

### Create and Store Embeddings

Finally, we'll prepare our content for RAG by:

1. Generating embeddings for each chunk of text
2. Creating a vector store index to hold our embeddings
3. Storing both the embeddings and metadata (original text and source information) in our vector database

> **Note**: This metadata is crucial as it allows us to return the actual content when the vector store finds relevant matches.

This allows our agent to efficiently search and retrieve relevant information.

```ts copy showLineNumbers{23} filename="src/store.ts"
// Generate embeddings
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  values: chunks.map((chunk) => chunk.text),
});

// Get the vector store instance from Mastra
const vectorStore = mastra.getVector("pgVector");

// Create an index for our paper chunks
await vectorStore.createIndex({
  indexName: "papers",
  dimension: 1536,
});

// Store embeddings
await vectorStore.upsert({
  indexName: "papers",
  vectors: embeddings,
  metadata: chunks.map((chunk) => ({
    text: chunk.text,
    source: "transformer-paper",
  })),
});
```

This will:

1. Load the paper from the URL
2. Split it into manageable chunks
3. Generate embeddings for each chunk
4. Store both the embeddings and text in our vector database

To run the script and store the embeddings:

```bash
npx bun src/store.ts
```

### Test the Assistant

Let's test our research assistant with different types of queries:

```ts filename="src/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";
const agent = mastra.getAgent("researchAgent");

// Basic query about concepts
const query1 =
  "What problems does sequence modeling face with neural networks?";
const response1 = await agent.generate(query1);
console.log("\nQuery:", query1);
console.log("Response:", response1.text);
```

Run the script:

```bash copy
npx bun src/index.ts
```

You should see output like:

```
Query: What problems does sequence modeling face with neural networks?
Response: Sequence modeling with neural networks faces several key challenges:
1. Vanishing and exploding gradients during training, especially with long sequences
2. Difficulty handling long-term dependencies in the input
3. Limited computational efficiency due to sequential processing
4. Challenges in parallelizing computations, resulting in longer training times
```

Let's try another question:

```ts filename="src/index.ts" showLineNumbers{10} copy
// Query about specific findings
const query2 = "What improvements were achieved in translation quality?";
const response2 = await agent.generate(query2);
console.log("\nQuery:", query2);
console.log("Response:", response2.text);
```

Output:

```
Query: What improvements were achieved in translation quality?
Response: The model showed significant improvements in translation quality, achieving more than 2.0
BLEU points improvement over previously reported models on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation
task, while also reducing training costs.
```

### Serve the Application

Start the Mastra server to expose your research assistant via API:

```bash
mastra dev
```

Your research assistant will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/agents/researchAgent/generate
```

Test with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/agents/researchAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "What were the main findings about model parallelization?" }
    ]
  }'
```

</Steps>

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";
import YouTube from "@/components/youtube";

# Stock Agent
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/guides/guide/stock-agent

We're going to create a simple agent that fetches the last day's closing stock price for a given symbol. This example will show you how to create a tool, add it to an agent, and use the agent to fetch stock prices.

<YouTube id="rIaZ4l7y9wo" />

## Project Structure

```
stock-price-agent/
├── src/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   └── stockAgent.ts
│   ├── tools/
│   │   └── stockPrices.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── package.json
└── .env
```

---

<Steps>
## Initialize the Project and Install Dependencies

First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir stock-price-agent
cd stock-price-agent
```

Initialize a new Node.js project and install the required dependencies:

```bash copy
npm init -y
npm install @mastra/core@latest zod @ai-sdk/openai
```

Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project to store your OpenAI API key.

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Create the necessary directories and files:

```bash
mkdir -p src/agents src/tools
touch src/agents/stockAgent.ts src/tools/stockPrices.ts src/index.ts
```

---

## Create the Stock Price Tool

Next, we'll create a tool that fetches the last day's closing stock price for a given symbol.

```ts filename="src/tools/stockPrices.ts"
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

const getStockPrice = async (symbol: string) => {
  const data = await fetch(
    `https://mastra-stock-data.vercel.app/api/stock-data?symbol=${symbol}`,
  ).then((r) => r.json());
  return data.prices["4. close"];
};

export const stockPrices = createTool({
  id: "Get Stock Price",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    symbol: z.string(),
  }),
  description: `Fetches the last day's closing stock price for a given symbol`,
  execute: async ({ context: { symbol } }) => {
    console.log("Using tool to fetch stock price for", symbol);
    return {
      symbol,
      currentPrice: await getStockPrice(symbol),
    };
  },
});
```

---

## Add the Tool to an Agent

We'll create an agent and add the `stockPrices` tool to it.

```ts filename="src/agents/stockAgent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

import * as tools from "../tools/stockPrices";

export const stockAgent = new Agent<typeof tools>({
  name: "Stock Agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that provides current stock prices. When asked about a stock, use the stock price tool to fetch the stock price.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    stockPrices: tools.stockPrices,
  },
});
```

---

## Set Up the Mastra Instance

We need to initialize the Mastra instance with our agent and tool.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

import { stockAgent } from "./agents/stockAgent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { stockAgent },
});
```

## Serve the Application

Instead of running the application directly, we'll use the `mastra dev` command to start the server. This will expose your agent via REST API endpoints, allowing you to interact with it over HTTP.

In your terminal, start the Mastra server by running:

```bash
mastra dev --dir src
```

This command will allow you to test your stockPrices tool and your stockAgent within the playground.

This will also start the server and make your agent available at:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/agents/stockAgent/generate
```

---

## Test the Agent with cURL

Now that your server is running, you can test your agent's endpoint using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/agents/stockAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "What is the current stock price of Apple (AAPL)?" }
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**

You should receive a JSON response similar to:

```json
{
  "text": "The current price of Apple (AAPL) is $174.55.",
  "agent": "Stock Agent"
}
```

This indicates that your agent successfully processed the request, used the `stockPrices` tool to fetch the stock price, and returned the result.

</Steps>

# `createTool()`
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/agents/createTool

The `createTool()` function creates typed tools that can be executed by agents or workflows. Tools have built-in schema validation, execution context, and integration with the Mastra ecosystem.

## Overview

Tools are a fundamental building block in Mastra that allow agents to interact with external systems, perform computations, and access data. Each tool has:

- A unique identifier
- A description that helps the AI understand when and how to use the tool
- Optional input and output schemas for validation
- An execution function that implements the tool's logic

## Example Usage

```ts filename="src/tools/stock-tools.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

// Helper function to fetch stock data
const getStockPrice = async (symbol: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://mastra-stock-data.vercel.app/api/stock-data?symbol=${symbol}`,
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.prices["4. close"];
};

// Create a tool to get stock prices
export const stockPriceTool = createTool({
  id: "getStockPrice",
  description: "Fetches the current stock price for a given ticker symbol",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    symbol: z.string().describe("The stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT)"),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    symbol: z.string(),
    price: z.number(),
    currency: z.string(),
    timestamp: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const price = await getStockPrice(context.symbol);

    return {
      symbol: context.symbol,
      price: parseFloat(price),
      currency: "USD",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    };
  },
});

// Create a tool that uses the thread context
export const threadInfoTool = createTool({
  id: "getThreadInfo",
  description: "Returns information about the current conversation thread",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    includeResource: z.boolean().optional().default(false),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, threadId, resourceId }) => {
    return {
      threadId,
      resourceId: context.includeResource ? resourceId : undefined,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    };
  },
});
```

          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

## Type Safety

The `createTool()` function provides full type safety through TypeScript generics:

- Input types are inferred from the `inputSchema`
- Output types are inferred from the `outputSchema`
- The execution context is properly typed based on the input schema

This ensures that your tools are type-safe throughout your application.

## Best Practices

1. **Descriptive IDs**: Use clear, action-oriented IDs like `getWeatherForecast` or `searchDatabase`
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide comprehensive descriptions that explain when and how to use the tool
3. **Input Validation**: Use Zod schemas to validate inputs and provide helpful error messages
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in your execute function
5. **Idempotency**: When possible, make your tools idempotent (same input always produces same output)
6. **Performance**: Keep tools lightweight and fast to execute

# Agent.generate()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/agents/generate

The `generate()` method is used to interact with an agent to produce text or structured responses. This method accepts `messages` and an optional `options` object as parameters.

## Parameters

### `messages`

The `messages` parameter can be:

- A single string
- An array of strings
- An array of message objects with `role` and `content` properties

The message object structure:

```typescript
interface Message {
  role: "system" | "user" | "assistant";
  content: string;
}
```

### `options` (Optional)

An optional object that can include configuration for output structure, memory management, tool usage, telemetry, and more.

# Agent.getMemory()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/agents/getMemory

The `getMemory()` method retrieves the memory system associated with an agent. This method is used to access the agent's memory capabilities for storing and retrieving information across conversations.

## Syntax

```typescript
getMemory(): MastraMemory | undefined
```

## Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

## Return Value

Returns a `MastraMemory` instance if a memory system is configured for the agent, or `undefined` if no memory system is configured.

## Description

The `getMemory()` method is used to access the memory system associated with an agent. Memory systems allow agents to:

- Store and retrieve information across multiple interactions
- Maintain conversation history
- Remember user preferences and context
- Provide personalized responses based on past interactions

This method is often used in conjunction with `hasOwnMemory()` to check if an agent has a memory system before attempting to use it.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create a memory system
const memory = new Memory();

// Create an agent with memory
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "memory-assistant",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that remembers previous conversations.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  memory,
});

// Get the memory system
const agentMemory = agent.getMemory();

if (agentMemory) {
  // Use the memory system to retrieve thread messages
  const thread = await agentMemory.getThreadById({
    resourceId: "user-123",
    threadId: "conversation-1",
  });

  console.log("Retrieved thread:", thread);
}
```

### Checking for Memory Before Using

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create an agent without memory
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "stateless-assistant",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
});

// Check if the agent has memory before using it
if (agent.hasOwnMemory()) {
  const memory = agent.getMemory();
  // Use memory...
} else {
  console.log("This agent does not have a memory system.");
}
```

### Using Memory in a Conversation

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create a memory system
const memory = new Memory();

// Create an agent with memory
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "memory-assistant",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that remembers previous conversations.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  memory,
});

// First interaction - store information
await agent.generate("My name is Alice.", {
  resourceId: "user-123",
  threadId: "conversation-1",
});

// Later interaction - retrieve information
const result = await agent.generate("What's my name?", {
  resourceId: "user-123",
  threadId: "conversation-1",
});

console.log(result.text); // Should mention "Alice"

// Access the memory system directly
const agentMemory = agent.getMemory();
if (agentMemory) {
  // Retrieve messages from the thread
  const { messages } = await agentMemory.query({
    resourceId: "user-123",
    threadId: "conversation-1",
    selectBy: {
      last: 10, // Get the last 10 messages
    },
  });

  console.log("Retrieved messages:", messages);
}
```

## Returns

The return value of the `stream()` method depends on the options provided, specifically the `output` option.

### PropertiesTable for Return Values

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "textStream",
      type: "AsyncIterable<string>",
      isOptional: true,
      description:
        "Stream of text chunks. Present when output is 'text' (no schema provided) or when using `experimental_output`.",
    },
    {
      name: "objectStream",
      type: "AsyncIterable<object>",
      isOptional: true,
      description:
        "Stream of structured data. Present only when using `output` option with a schema.",
    },
    {
      name: "partialObjectStream",
      type: "AsyncIterable<object>",
      isOptional: true,
      description:
        "Stream of structured data. Present only when using `experimental_output` option.",
    },
    {
      name: "object",
      type: "Promise<object>",
      isOptional: true,
      description:
        "Promise that resolves to the final structured output. Present when using either `output` or `experimental_output` options.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Basic Text Streaming

```typescript
const stream = await myAgent.stream([
  { role: "user", content: "Tell me a story." },
]);

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

### Structured Output Streaming with Thread Context

```typescript
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    summary: { type: "string" },
    nextSteps: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
  },
  required: ["summary", "nextSteps"],
};

const response = await myAgent.stream("What should we do next?", {
  output: schema,
  threadId: "project-123",
  onFinish: (text) => console.log("Finished:", text),
});

for await (const chunk of response.textStream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}

const result = await response.object;
console.log("Final structured result:", result);
```

The key difference between Agent's `stream()` and LLM's `stream()` is that Agents maintain conversation context through `threadId`, can access tools, and integrate with the agent's memory system.

# mastra build
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/cli/build

The `mastra build` command bundles your Mastra project into a production-ready Hono server. Hono is a lightweight, type-safe web framework that makes it easy to deploy Mastra agents as HTTP endpoints with middleware support.

## Usage

```bash
mastra build [options]
```

## Options

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "--dir",
      type: "string",
      description: "Path to your Mastra Folder",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "--root",
      type: "string",
      description: "Path to your root folder",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "--tools",
      type: "string",
      description: "Comma-separated list of paths to tool files to include",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "--env",
      type: "string", 
      description: "Path to custom environment file",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "--help",
      type: "boolean",
      description: "display help for command",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Advanced usage

### Limit parallelism

For CI or when running in resource constrained environments you can cap
how many expensive tasks run at once by setting `MASTRA_CONCURRENCY`.

```bash copy
MASTRA_CONCURRENCY=2 mastra build
```

Unset it to allow the CLI to base concurrency on the host capabilities.

### Disable telemetry

To opt out of anonymous build analytics set:

```bash copy
MASTRA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 mastra build
```

### Custom provider endpoints

Build time respects the same `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
variables that `mastra dev` does. They are forwarded by the AI SDK to
any workflows or tools that call the providers.

## What It Does

1. Locates your Mastra entry file (either `src/mastra/index.ts` or `src/mastra/index.js`)
2. Creates a `.mastra` output directory
3. Bundles your code using Rollup with:
   - Tree shaking for optimal bundle size
   - Node.js environment targeting
   - Source map generation for debugging

## Example

```bash copy
# Build from current directory
mastra build

# Build from specific directory
mastra build --dir ./my-mastra-project
```

## Output

The command generates a production bundle in the `.mastra` directory, which includes:

- A Hono-based HTTP server with your Mastra agents exposed as endpoints
- Bundled JavaScript files optimized for production
- Source maps for debugging
- Required dependencies

This output is suitable for:

- Deploying to cloud servers (EC2, Digital Ocean)
- Running in containerized environments
- Using with container orchestration systems

## Deployers

When a Deployer is used, the build output is automatically prepared for the target platform e.g

- [Vercel Deployer](/reference/deployer/vercel)
- [Netlify Deployer](/reference/deployer/netlify)
- [Cloudflare Deployer](/reference/deployer/cloudflare)

## Additional Notes

The port defaults to 5000. Both the port and hostname can be configured via the mastra server config. See [Launch Development Server](/docs/server-db/local-dev-playground) for configuration details.

Make sure you have your environment variables set up in your `.env.development` or `.env` file for any providers you use (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.).

Make sure the `index.ts` file in your Mastra folder exports the Mastra instance for the dev server to read.

### Example request

To test an agent after running `mastra dev`:

```bash copy
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/agents/myAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, how can you assist me today?" }
    ]
  }'
```

## Advanced usage

The `mastra dev` server obeys a few extra environment variables that can
be handy during development:

### Disable build caching

Set `MASTRA_DEV_NO_CACHE=1` to force a full rebuild rather than using
the cached assets under `.mastra/`:

```bash copy
MASTRA_DEV_NO_CACHE=1 mastra dev
```

This helps when you are debugging bundler plugins or suspect stale
output.

### Limit parallelism

`MASTRA_CONCURRENCY` caps how many expensive operations run in parallel
(primarily build and evaluation steps). For example:

```bash copy
MASTRA_CONCURRENCY=4 mastra dev
```

Leave it unset to let the CLI pick a sensible default for the machine.

### Custom provider endpoints

When using providers supported by the Vercel AI SDK you can redirect
requests through proxies or internal gateways by setting a base URL. For
OpenAI:

```bash copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key> \
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.example/v1 \
mastra dev
```

and for Anthropic:

```bash copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key> \
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://anthropic.internal \
mastra dev
```

These are forwarded by the AI SDK and work with any `openai()` or
`anthropic()` calls.

### Disable telemetry

To opt out of anonymous CLI analytics set
`MASTRA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`. This also prevents tracking within the
local playground.

```bash copy
MASTRA_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 mastra dev
```

description: Learn how to interact with Mastra AI agents, including generating responses, streaming interactions, and managing agent tools using the client-js SDK.
---

# Agents API
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/client-js/agents

The Agents API provides methods to interact with Mastra AI agents, including generating responses, streaming interactions, and managing agent tools.

## Initialize Mastra Client

```typescript
import { MastraClient } from "@mastra/client-js";

const client = new MastraClient();
```

## Getting All Agents

Retrieve a list of all available agents:

```typescript
const agents = await client.getAgents();
```

## Working with a Specific Agent

Get an instance of a specific agent:

```typescript
const agent = client.getAgent("agent-id");
```

## Agent Methods

### Get Agent Details

Retrieve detailed information about an agent:

```typescript
const details = await agent.details();
```

### Generate Response

Generate a response from the agent:

```typescript
const response = await agent.generate({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Hello, how are you?",
    },
  ],
  threadId: "thread-1", // Optional: Thread ID for conversation context
  resourceid: "resource-1", // Optional: Resource ID
  output: {}, // Optional: Output configuration
});
```

### Stream Response

Stream responses from the agent for real-time interactions:

```typescript
const response = await agent.stream({
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Tell me a story",
    },
  ],
});

// Process data stream with the processDataStream util
response.processDataStream({
  onTextPart: (text) => {
    process.stdout.write(text);
  },
  onFilePart: (file) => {
    console.log(file);
  },
  onDataPart: (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  },
  onErrorPart: (error) => {
    console.error(error);
  },
});

// Process text stream with the processTextStream util 
// (used with structured output)
 response.processTextStream({
      onTextPart: text => {
        process.stdout.write(text);
      },
});

// You can also read from response body directly
const reader = response.body.getReader();
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  console.log(new TextDecoder().decode(value));
}
```

### Client tools

Client-side tools allow you to execute custom functions on the client side when the agent requests them.

#### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { createTool } from '@mastra/core/tools';
import { z } from 'zod';

const colorChangeTool = createTool({
  id: 'changeColor',
  description: 'Changes the background color',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    color: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = context.color;
    return { success: true };
  }
})


// Use with generate
const response = await agent.generate({
  messages: 'Change the background to blue',
  clientTools: {colorChangeTool},
});

// Use with stream
const response = await agent.stream({
  messages: 'Change the background to green',
  clientTools: {colorChangeTool},
});

response.processDataStream({
  onTextPart: (text) => console.log(text),
  onToolCallPart: (toolCall) => console.log('Tool called:', toolCall.toolName),
});
```

### Get Agent Tool

Retrieve information about a specific tool available to the agent:

```typescript
const tool = await agent.getTool("tool-id");
```

### Get Agent Evaluations

Get evaluation results for the agent:

```typescript
// Get CI evaluations
const evals = await agent.evals();

// Get live evaluations
const liveEvals = await agent.liveEvals();
```

title: Mastra Client Error Handling
description: Learn about the built-in retry mechanism and error handling capabilities in the Mastra client-js SDK.
---

# Error Handling
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/client-js/error-handling

The Mastra Client SDK includes built-in retry mechanism and error handling capabilities.

## Error Handling

All API methods can throw errors that you can catch and handle:

```typescript
try {
  const agent = client.getAgent("agent-id");
  const response = await agent.generate({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
}
```

## Retry Mechanism

The client automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff:

```typescript
const client = new MastraClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:5000",
  retries: 3, // Number of retry attempts
  backoffMs: 300, // Initial backoff time
  maxBackoffMs: 5000, // Maximum backoff time
});
```

### How Retries Work

1. First attempt fails → Wait 300ms
2. Second attempt fails → Wait 600ms
3. Third attempt fails → Wait 1200ms
4. Final attempt fails → Throw error

  });

  const result = await workflow.start({
    runId: run.runId,
    inputData: {
      city: "New York",
    },
  });
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

### Resume Workflow

  });
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

### Get Workflow Run result

Get the result of a workflow run:

```typescript
try  {
  const workflow = client.getWorkflow("testWorkflow");

  const run = await workflow.createRun();

  // start the workflow run
  const startResult = await workflow.start({
    runId: run.runId,
    inputData: {
      city: "New York",
    },
  });

  const result = await workflow.runExecutionResult(run.runId);

  console.log(result);
} catch (e) {
  console.error(e);
}
```

This is useful when dealing with long running workflows. You can use this to poll the result of the workflow run.

# The Mastra Class
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/core/mastra-class

The `Mastra` class is the central orchestrator in any Mastra application, managing agents, workflows, storage, logging, telemetry, and more. Typically, you create a single instance of `Mastra` to coordinate your application.

Think of `Mastra` as a top-level registry:

- Registering **integrations** makes them accessible to **agents**, **workflows**, and **tools** alike.
- **tools** aren’t registered on `Mastra` directly but are associated with agents and discovered automatically.


## Importing

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
```

## Constructor

Creates a new `Mastra` instance with the specified configuration.

```typescript
constructor(config?: Config);
```

## Initialization

The Mastra class is typically initialized in your `src/mastra/index.ts` file:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weather-agent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent },
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    url: ":memory:",
  }),
});
```

## Configuration Object

The constructor accepts an optional `Config` object to customize its behavior and integrate various Mastra components. All properties on the `Config` object are optional.

# Deployer
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/deployer/deployer

The Deployer handles the deployment of standalone Mastra applications by packaging code, managing environment files, and serving applications using the Hono framework. Concrete implementations must define the deploy method for specific deployment targets.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Deployer } from "@mastra/deployer";

// Create a custom deployer by extending the abstract Deployer class
class CustomDeployer extends Deployer {
  constructor() {
    super({ name: "custom-deployer" });
  }

  // Implement the abstract deploy method
  async deploy(outputDirectory: string): Promise<void> {
    // Prepare the output directory
    await this.prepare(outputDirectory);

    // Bundle the application
    await this._bundle("server.ts", "mastra.ts", outputDirectory);

    // Custom deployment logic
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Parameters

### Constructor Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "args",
      type: "object",
      description: "Configuration options for the Deployer.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "args.name",
      type: "string",
      description: "A unique name for the deployer instance.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

### deploy Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "outputDirectory",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The directory where the bundled and deployment-ready application will be output.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Methods

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "getEnvFiles",
      type: "() => Promise<string[]>",
      description:
        "Returns a list of environment files to be used during deployment. By default, it looks for '.env.production' and '.env' files.",
    },
    {
      name: "deploy",
      type: "(outputDirectory: string) => Promise<void>",
      description:
        "Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. Handles the deployment process to the specified output directory.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Inherited Methods from Bundler

The Deployer class inherits the following key methods from the Bundler class:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "prepare",
      type: "(outputDirectory: string) => Promise<void>",
      description:
        "Prepares the output directory by cleaning it and creating necessary subdirectories.",
    },
    {
      name: "writeInstrumentationFile",
      type: "(outputDirectory: string) => Promise<void>",
      description:
        "Writes an instrumentation file to the output directory for telemetry purposes.",
    },
    {
      name: "writePackageJson",
      type: "(outputDirectory: string, dependencies: Map<string, string>) => Promise<void>",
      description:
        "Generates a package.json file in the output directory with the specified dependencies.",
    },
    {
      name: "_bundle",
      type: "(serverFile: string, mastraEntryFile: string, outputDirectory: string, bundleLocation?: string) => Promise<void>",
      description:
        "Bundles the application using the specified server and Mastra entry files.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Core Concepts

### Deployment Lifecycle

The Deployer abstract class implements a structured deployment lifecycle:

1. **Initialization**: The deployer is initialized with a name and creates a Deps instance for dependency management.
2. **Environment Setup**: The `getEnvFiles` method identifies environment files (.env.production, .env) to be used during deployment.
3. **Preparation**: The `prepare` method (inherited from Bundler) cleans the output directory and creates necessary subdirectories.
4. **Bundling**: The `_bundle` method (inherited from Bundler) packages the application code and its dependencies.
5. **Deployment**: The abstract `deploy` method is implemented by subclasses to handle the actual deployment process.

### Environment File Management

The Deployer class includes built-in support for environment file management through the `getEnvFiles` method. This method:

- Looks for environment files in a predefined order (.env.production, .env)
- Uses the FileService to find the first existing file
- Returns an array of found environment files
- Returns an empty array if no environment files are found

```typescript
getEnvFiles(): Promise<string[]> {
  const possibleFiles = ['.env.production', '.env.local', '.env'];

  try {
    const fileService = new FileService();
    const envFile = fileService.getFirstExistingFile(possibleFiles);

    return Promise.resolve([envFile]);
  } catch {}

  return Promise.resolve([]);
}
```

### Bundling and Deployment Relationship

The Deployer class extends the Bundler class, establishing a clear relationship between bundling and deployment:

1. **Bundling as a Prerequisite**: Bundling is a prerequisite step for deployment, where the application code is packaged into a deployable format.
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Both bundling and deployment share common infrastructure like dependency management and file system operations.
3. **Specialized Deployment Logic**: While bundling focuses on code packaging, deployment adds environment-specific logic for deploying the bundled code.
4. **Extensibility**: The abstract `deploy` method allows for creating specialized deployers for different target environments.

# .after()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/after

The `.after()` method defines explicit dependencies between workflow steps, enabling branching and merging paths in your workflow execution.

## Usage

### Basic Branching

```typescript
workflow
  .step(stepA)
  .then(stepB)
  .after(stepA) // Create new branch after stepA completes
  .step(stepC);
```

### Merging Multiple Branches

```typescript
workflow
  .step(stepA)
  .then(stepB)
  .step(stepC)
  .then(stepD)
  .after([stepB, stepD]) // Create a step that depends on multiple steps
  .step(stepE);
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "steps",
      type: "Step | Step[]",
      description:
        "A single step or array of steps that must complete before continuing",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "workflow",
      type: "LegacyWorkflow",
      description: "The workflow instance for method chaining",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Single Dependency

```typescript
workflow
  .step(fetchData)
  .then(processData)
  .after(fetchData) // Branch after fetchData
  .step(logData);
```

### Multiple Dependencies (Merging Branches)

```typescript
workflow
  .step(fetchUserData)
  .then(validateUserData)
  .step(fetchProductData)
  .then(validateProductData)
  .after([validateUserData, validateProductData]) // Wait for both validations to complete
  .step(processOrder);
```

# afterEvent()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/afterEvent

The `afterEvent()` method creates a suspension point in your workflow that waits for a specific event to occur before continuing execution.

## Syntax

```typescript
workflow.afterEvent(eventName: string): Workflow
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eventName | string | The name of the event to wait for. Must match an event defined in the workflow's `events` configuration. |

## Return Value

Returns the workflow instance for method chaining.

## Description

The `afterEvent()` method is used to create an automatic suspension point in your workflow that waits for a specific named event. It's essentially a declarative way to define a point where your workflow should pause and wait for an external event to occur.

When you call `afterEvent()`, Mastra:

1. Creates a special step with ID `__eventName_event`
2. This step automatically suspends the workflow execution
3. The workflow remains suspended until the specified event is triggered via `resumeWithEvent()`
4. When the event occurs, execution continues with the step following the `afterEvent()` call

This method is part of Mastra's event-driven workflow capabilities, allowing you to create workflows that coordinate with external systems or user interactions without manually implementing suspension logic.

## Usage Notes

- The event specified in `afterEvent()` must be defined in the workflow's `events` configuration with a schema
- The special step created has a predictable ID format: `__eventName_event` (e.g., `__approvalReceived_event`)
- Any step following `afterEvent()` can access the event data via `context.inputData.resumedEvent`
- Event data is validated against the schema defined for that event when `resumeWithEvent()` is called

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

// Define workflow with events
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "approval-workflow",
  events: {
    approval: {
      schema: z.object({
        approved: z.boolean(),
        approverName: z.string(),
      }),
    },
  },
});

// Build workflow with event suspension point
workflow
  .step(submitRequest)
  .afterEvent("approval") // Workflow suspends here
  .step(processApproval) // This step runs after the event occurs
  .commit();
```

The `.commit()` method re-initializes the workflow's state machine with the current step configuration.

## Usage

```typescript
workflow.step(stepA).then(stepB).commit();
```

## Returns

title: "Reference: Workflow.createRun() | Running Workflows (Legacy) | Mastra Docs"
description: "Documentation for the `.createRun()` method in workflows (legacy), which initializes a new workflow run instance."
---

# Workflow.createRun()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/createRun

The `.createRun()` method initializes a new workflow run instance. It generates a unique run ID for tracking and returns a start function that begins workflow execution when called.

One reason to use `.createRun()` vs `.execute()` is to get a unique run ID for tracking, logging, or subscribing via `.watch()`.

## Usage

```typescript
const { runId, start, watch } = workflow.createRun();

const result = await start();
```

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "runId",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for tracking this workflow run",
    },
    {
      name: "start",
      type: "() => Promise<LegacyWorkflowResult>",
      description: "Function that begins workflow execution when called",
    },
    {
      name: "watch",
      type: "(callback: (record: LegacyWorkflowResult) => void) => () => void",
      description:
        "Function that accepts a callback function that will be called with each transition of the workflow run",
    },
    {
      name: "resume",
      type: "({stepId: string, context: Record<string, any>}) => Promise<LegacyWorkflowResult>",
      description:
        "Function that resumes a workflow run from a given step ID and context",
    },
    {
      name: "resumeWithEvent",
      type: "(eventName: string, data: any) => Promise<LegacyWorkflowResult>",
      description:
        "Function that resumes a workflow run from a given event name and data",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Error Handling

The start function may throw validation errors if the workflow configuration is invalid:

```typescript
try {
  const { runId, start, watch, resume, resumeWithEvent } = workflow.createRun();
  await start({ triggerData: data });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    // Handle validation errors
    console.log(error.type); // 'circular_dependency' | 'no_terminal_path' | 'unreachable_step'
    console.log(error.details);
  }
}
```

title: "Reference: Workflow.else() | Conditional Branching | Mastra Docs"
description: "Documentation for the `.else()` method in Mastra workflows, which creates an alternative branch when an if condition is false."
---

# Workflow.else()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/else

> Experimental

The `.else()` method creates an alternative branch in the workflow that executes when the preceding `if` condition evaluates to false. This enables workflows to follow different paths based on conditions.

## Usage

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
workflow
  .step(startStep)
  .if(async ({ context }) => {
    const value = context.getStepResult<{ value: number }>("start")?.value;
    return value < 10;
  })
  .then(ifBranchStep)
  .else() // Alternative branch when the condition is false
  .then(elseBranchStep)
  .commit();
```

## Parameters

The `else()` method does not take any parameters.

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "workflow",
      type: "LegacyWorkflow",
      description: "The workflow instance for method chaining",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Behavior

- The `else()` method must follow an `if()` branch in the workflow definition
- It creates a branch that executes only when the preceding `if` condition evaluates to false
- You can chain multiple steps after an `else()` using `.then()`
- You can nest additional `if`/`else` conditions within an `else` branch

## Error Handling

The `else()` method requires a preceding `if()` statement. If you try to use it without a preceding `if`, an error will be thrown:

```typescript
try {
  // This will throw an error
  workflow.step(someStep).else().then(anotherStep).commit();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // "No active condition found"
}
```

# Event-Driven Workflows
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/events

Mastra provides built-in support for event-driven workflows through the `afterEvent` and `resumeWithEvent` methods. These methods allow you to create workflows that pause execution while waiting for specific events to occur, then resume with the event data when it's available.

## Overview

Event-driven workflows are useful for scenarios where:

- You need to wait for external systems to complete processing
- User approval or input is required at specific points
- Asynchronous operations need to be coordinated
- Long-running processes need to break up execution across different services

## Defining Events

Before using event-driven methods, you must define the events your workflow will listen for in the workflow configuration:

```typescript
import { LegacyWorkflow } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "approval-workflow",
  triggerSchema: z.object({ requestId: z.string() }),
  events: {
    // Define events with their validation schemas
    approvalReceived: {
      schema: z.object({
        approved: z.boolean(),
        approverName: z.string(),
        comment: z.string().optional(),
      }),
    },
    documentUploaded: {
      schema: z.object({
        documentId: z.string(),
        documentType: z.enum(["invoice", "receipt", "contract"]),
        metadata: z.record(z.string()).optional(),
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

Each event must have a name and a schema that defines the structure of data expected when the event occurs.

## afterEvent()

The `afterEvent` method creates a suspension point in your workflow that automatically waits for a specific event.

### Syntax

```typescript
workflow.afterEvent(eventName: string): LegacyWorkflow
```

### Parameters

- `eventName`: The name of the event to wait for (must be defined in the workflow's `events` configuration)

### Return Value

Returns the workflow instance for method chaining.

### How It Works

When `afterEvent` is called, Mastra:

1. Creates a special step with ID `__eventName_event`
2. Configures this step to automatically suspend workflow execution
3. Sets up the continuation point after the event is received

### Usage Example

```typescript
workflow
  .step(initialProcessStep)
  .afterEvent("approvalReceived") // Workflow suspends here
  .step(postApprovalStep) // This runs after event is received
  .then(finalStep)
  .commit();
```

## resumeWithEvent()

The `resumeWithEvent` method resumes a suspended workflow by providing data for a specific event.

### Syntax

```typescript
run.resumeWithEvent(eventName: string, data: any): Promise<LegacyWorkflowRunResult>
```

### Parameters

- `eventName`: The name of the event being triggered
- `data`: The event data (must conform to the schema defined for this event)

### Return Value

Returns a Promise that resolves to the workflow execution results after resumption.

### How It Works

When `resumeWithEvent` is called, Mastra:

1. Validates the event data against the schema defined for that event
2. Loads the workflow snapshot
3. Updates the context with the event data
4. Resumes execution from the event step
5. Continues workflow execution with the subsequent steps

### Usage Example

```typescript
// Create a workflow run
const run = workflow.createRun();

// Start the workflow
await run.start({ triggerData: { requestId: "req-123" } });

// Later, when the event occurs:
const result = await run.resumeWithEvent("approvalReceived", {
  approved: true,
  approverName: "John Doe",
  comment: "Looks good to me!",
});

console.log(result.results);
```

## Accessing Event Data

When a workflow is resumed with event data, that data is available in the step context as `context.inputData.resumedEvent`:

```typescript
const processApprovalStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processApproval",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    // Access the event data
    const eventData = context.inputData.resumedEvent;

    return {
      processingResult: `Processed approval from ${eventData.approverName}`,
      wasApproved: eventData.approved,
    };
  },
});
```

## Multiple Events

You can create workflows that wait for multiple different events at various points:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(createRequest)
  .afterEvent("approvalReceived")
  .step(processApproval)
  .afterEvent("documentUploaded")
  .step(processDocument)
  .commit();
```

When resuming a workflow with multiple event suspension points, you need to provide the correct event name and data for the current suspension point.

## Practical Example

This example shows a complete workflow that requires both approval and document upload:

```typescript
import { LegacyWorkflow, LegacyStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define steps
const createRequest = new LegacyStep({
  id: "createRequest",
  execute: async () => ({ requestId: `req-${Date.now()}` }),
});

const processApproval = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processApproval",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const approvalData = context.inputData.resumedEvent;
    return {
      approved: approvalData.approved,
      approver: approvalData.approverName,
    };
  },
});

const processDocument = new LegacyStep({
  id: "processDocument",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const documentData = context.inputData.resumedEvent;
    return {
      documentId: documentData.documentId,
      processed: true,
      type: documentData.documentType,
    };
  },
});

const finalizeRequest = new LegacyStep({
  id: "finalizeRequest",
  execute: async ({ context }) => {
    const requestId = context.steps.createRequest.output.requestId;
    const approved = context.steps.processApproval.output.approved;
    const documentId = context.steps.processDocument.output.documentId;

    return {
      finalized: true,
      summary: `Request ${requestId} was ${approved ? "approved" : "rejected"} with document ${documentId}`,
    };
  },
});

// Create workflow
const requestWorkflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "document-request-workflow",
  events: {
    approvalReceived: {
      schema: z.object({
        approved: z.boolean(),
        approverName: z.string(),
      }),
    },
    documentUploaded: {
      schema: z.object({
        documentId: z.string(),
        documentType: z.enum(["invoice", "receipt", "contract"]),
      }),
    },
  },
});

// Build workflow
requestWorkflow
  .step(createRequest)
  .afterEvent("approvalReceived")
  .step(processApproval)
  .afterEvent("documentUploaded")
  .step(processDocument)
  .then(finalizeRequest)
  .commit();

// Export workflow
export { requestWorkflow };
```

### Running the Example Workflow

```typescript
import { requestWorkflow } from "./workflows";
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

async function runWorkflow() {
  // Get the workflow
  const workflow = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("document-request-workflow");
  const run = workflow.createRun();

  // Start the workflow
  const initialResult = await run.start();
  console.log("Workflow started:", initialResult.results);

  // Simulate receiving approval
  const afterApprovalResult = await run.resumeWithEvent("approvalReceived", {
    approved: true,
    approverName: "Jane Smith",
  });
  console.log("After approval:", afterApprovalResult.results);

  // Simulate document upload
  const finalResult = await run.resumeWithEvent("documentUploaded", {
    documentId: "doc-456",
    documentType: "invoice",
  });
  console.log("Final result:", finalResult.results);
}

runWorkflow().catch(console.error);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Event Schemas**: Use Zod to create precise schemas for event data validation
2. **Use Descriptive Event Names**: Choose event names that clearly communicate their purpose
3. **Handle Missing Events**: Ensure your workflow can handle cases where events don't occur or time out
4. **Include Monitoring**: Use the `watch` method to monitor suspended workflows waiting for events
5. **Consider Timeouts**: Implement timeout mechanisms for events that may never occur
6. **Document Events**: Clearly document the events your workflow depends on for other developers

title: "Reference: Workflow.if() | Conditional Branching | Mastra Docs"
description: "Documentation for the `.if()` method in Mastra workflows, which creates conditional branches based on specified conditions."
---

# Workflow.if()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/if

> Experimental

The `.if()` method creates a conditional branch in the workflow, allowing steps to execute only when a specified condition is true. This enables dynamic workflow paths based on the results of previous steps.

## Usage

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
workflow
  .step(startStep)
  .if(async ({ context }) => {
    const value = context.getStepResult<{ value: number }>("start")?.value;
    return value < 10; // If true, execute the "if" branch
  })
  .then(ifBranchStep)
  .else()
  .then(elseBranchStep)
  .commit();
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "condition",
      type: "Function | ReferenceCondition",
      description:
        "A function or reference condition that determines whether to execute the 'if' branch",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Condition Types

### Function Condition

You can use a function that returns a boolean:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(startStep)
  .if(async ({ context }) => {
    const result = context.getStepResult<{ status: string }>("start");
    return result?.status === "success"; // Execute "if" branch when status is "success"
  })
  .then(successStep)
  .else()
  .then(failureStep);
```

### Reference Condition

You can use a reference-based condition with comparison operators:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(startStep)
  .if({
    ref: { step: startStep, path: "value" },
    query: { $lt: 10 }, // Execute "if" branch when value is less than 10
  })
  .then(ifBranchStep)
  .else()
  .then(elseBranchStep);
```

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "workflow",
      type: "LegacyWorkflow",
      description: "The workflow instance for method chaining",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Error Handling

The `if` method requires a previous step to be defined. If you try to use it without a preceding step, an error will be thrown:

```typescript
try {
  // This will throw an error
  workflow
    .if(async ({ context }) => true)
    .then(someStep)
    .commit();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error); // "Condition requires a step to be executed after"
}
```

      description:
        "New context data to inject into the step's inputData property",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "Promise<LegacyWorkflowResult>",
      type: "object",
      description: "Result of the resumed workflow execution",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Async/Await Flow

When a workflow is resumed, execution continues from the point immediately after the `suspend()` call in the step's execution function. This creates a natural flow in your code:

```typescript
// Step definition with suspend point
const reviewStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "review",
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    // First part of execution
    const initialAnalysis = analyzeData(context.inputData.data);

    if (initialAnalysis.needsReview) {
      // Suspend execution here
      await suspend({ analysis: initialAnalysis });

      // This code runs after resume() is called
      // context.inputData now contains any data provided during resume
      return {
        reviewedData: enhanceWithFeedback(
          initialAnalysis,
          context.inputData.feedback,
        ),
      };
    }

    return { reviewedData: initialAnalysis };
  },
});

const { runId, resume, start } = workflow.createRun();

await start({
  inputData: {
    data: "some data",
  },
});

// Later, resume the workflow
const result = await resume({
  runId: "workflow-123",
  stepId: "review",
  context: {
    // This data will be available in `context.inputData`
    feedback: "Looks good, but improve section 3",
  },
});
```

### Execution Flow

1. The workflow runs until it hits `await suspend()` in the `review` step
2. The workflow state is persisted and execution pauses
3. Later, `run.resume()` is called with new context data
4. Execution continues from the point after `suspend()` in the `review` step
5. The new context data (`feedback`) is available to the step on the `inputData` property
6. The step completes and returns its result
7. The workflow continues with subsequent steps

## Error Handling

The resume function may throw several types of errors:

```typescript
try {
  await run.resume({
    runId,
    stepId: "stepTwo",
    context: newData,
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message === "No snapshot found for workflow run") {
    // Handle missing workflow state
  }
  if (error.message === "Failed to parse workflow snapshot") {
    // Handle corrupted workflow state
  }
}
```

title: ".resumeWithEvent() Method | Mastra Docs"
description: "Reference for the resumeWithEvent method that resumes suspended workflows using event data."
---

# resumeWithEvent()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/resumeWithEvent

The `resumeWithEvent()` method resumes workflow execution by providing data for a specific event that the workflow is waiting for.

## Syntax

```typescript
const run = workflow.createRun();

// After the workflow has started and suspended at an event step
await run.resumeWithEvent(eventName: string, data: any): Promise<WorkflowRunResult>
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eventName | string | The name of the event to trigger. Must match an event defined in the workflow's `events` configuration. |
| data      | any    | The event data to provide. Must conform to the schema defined for that event.                           |

## Return Value

Returns a Promise that resolves to a `WorkflowRunResult` object, containing:

- `results`: The result status and output of each step in the workflow
- `activePaths`: A map of active workflow paths and their states
- `value`: The current state value of the workflow
- Other workflow execution metadata

## Description

The `resumeWithEvent()` method is used to resume a workflow that has been suspended at an event step created by the `afterEvent()` method. When called, this method:

1. Validates the provided event data against the schema defined for that event
2. Loads the workflow snapshot from storage
3. Updates the context with the event data in the `resumedEvent` field
4. Resumes execution from the event step
5. Continues workflow execution with the subsequent steps

This method is part of Mastra's event-driven workflow capabilities, allowing you to create workflows that can respond to external events or user interactions.

## Usage Notes

- The workflow must be in a suspended state, specifically at the event step created by `afterEvent(eventName)`
- The event data must conform to the schema defined for that event in the workflow configuration
- The workflow will continue execution from the point it was suspended
- If the workflow is not suspended or is suspended at a different step, this method may throw an error
- The event data is made available to subsequent steps via `context.inputData.resumedEvent`

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Define and start a workflow
const workflow = mastra.legacy_getWorkflow("approval-workflow");
const run = workflow.createRun();

// Start the workflow
await run.start({ triggerData: { requestId: "req-123" } });

// Later, when the approval event occurs:
const result = await run.resumeWithEvent("approval", {
  approved: true,
  approverName: "John Doe",
  comment: "Looks good to me!",
});

console.log(result.results);
```

### With Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  const result = await run.resumeWithEvent("paymentReceived", {
    amount: 100.5,
    transactionId: "tx-456",
    paymentMethod: "credit-card",
  });

  console.log("Workflow resumed successfully:", result.results);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to resume workflow with event:", error);
  // Handle error - could be invalid event data, workflow not suspended, etc.
}
```

### Monitoring and Auto-Resuming

```typescript
// Start a workflow
const { start, watch, resumeWithEvent } = workflow.createRun();

// Watch for suspended event steps
watch(async ({ activePaths }) => {
  const isApprovalEventSuspended =
    activePaths.get("__approval_event")?.status === "suspended";
  // Check if suspended at the approval event step
  if (isApprovalEventSuspended) {
    console.log("Workflow waiting for approval");

    // In a real scenario, you would wait for the actual event
    // Here we're simulating with a timeout
    setTimeout(async () => {
      try {
        await resumeWithEvent("approval", {
          approved: true,
          approverName: "Auto Approver",
        });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to auto-resume workflow:", error);
      }
    }, 5000); // Wait 5 seconds before auto-approving
  }
});

// Start the workflow
await start({ triggerData: { requestId: "auto-123" } });
```

title: "Reference: Snapshots | Workflow State Persistence (Legacy) | Mastra Docs"
description: "Technical reference on snapshots in Mastra - the serialized workflow state that enables suspend and resume functionality"
---

# Snapshots
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/snapshots

In Mastra, a snapshot is a serializable representation of a workflow's complete execution state at a specific point in time. Snapshots capture all the information needed to resume a workflow from exactly where it left off, including:

- The current state of each step in the workflow
- The outputs of completed steps
- The execution path taken through the workflow
- Any suspended steps and their metadata
- The remaining retry attempts for each step
- Additional contextual data needed to resume execution

Snapshots are automatically created and managed by Mastra whenever a workflow is suspended, and are persisted to the configured storage system.

## The Role of Snapshots in Suspend and Resume

Snapshots are the key mechanism enabling Mastra's suspend and resume capabilities. When a workflow step calls `await suspend()`:

1. The workflow execution is paused at that exact point
2. The current state of the workflow is captured as a snapshot
3. The snapshot is persisted to storage
4. The workflow step is marked as "suspended" with a status of `'suspended'`
5. Later, when `resume()` is called on the suspended step, the snapshot is retrieved
6. The workflow execution resumes from exactly where it left off

This mechanism provides a powerful way to implement human-in-the-loop workflows, handle rate limiting, wait for external resources, and implement complex branching workflows that may need to pause for extended periods.

## Snapshot Anatomy

A Mastra workflow snapshot consists of several key components:

```typescript
export interface LegacyWorkflowRunState {
  // Core state info
  value: Record<string, string>; // Current state machine value
  context: {
    // Workflow context
    steps: Record<
      string,
      {
        // Step execution results
        status: "success" | "failed" | "suspended" | "waiting" | "skipped";
        payload?: any; // Step-specific data
        error?: string; // Error info if failed
      }
    >;
    triggerData: Record<string, any>; // Initial trigger data
    attempts: Record<string, number>; // Remaining retry attempts
    inputData: Record<string, any>; // Initial input data
  };

  activePaths: Array<{
    // Currently active execution paths
    stepPath: string[];
    stepId: string;
    status: string;
  }>;

  // Metadata
  runId: string; // Unique run identifier
  timestamp: number; // Time snapshot was created

  // For nested workflows and suspended steps
  childStates?: Record<string, WorkflowRunState>; // Child workflow states
  suspendedSteps?: Record<string, string>; // Mapping of suspended steps
}
```

## How Snapshots Are Saved and Retrieved

Mastra persists snapshots to the configured storage system. By default, snapshots are saved to a LibSQL database, but can be configured to use other storage providers like Upstash.
The snapshots are stored in the `workflow_snapshots` table and identified uniquely by the `run_id` for the associated run when using libsql.
Utilizing a persistence layer allows for the snapshots to be persisted across workflow runs, allowing for advanced human-in-the-loop functionality.

Read more about [libsql storage](../storage/libsql.mdx) and [upstash storage](../storage/upstash.mdx) here.

### Saving Snapshots

When a workflow is suspended, Mastra automatically persists the workflow snapshot with these steps:

1. The `suspend()` function in a step execution triggers the snapshot process
2. The `WorkflowInstance.suspend()` method records the suspended machine
3. `persistWorkflowSnapshot()` is called to save the current state
4. The snapshot is serialized and stored in the configured database in the `workflow_snapshots` table
5. The storage record includes the workflow name, run ID, and the serialized snapshot

### Retrieving Snapshots

When a workflow is resumed, Mastra retrieves the persisted snapshot with these steps:

1. The `resume()` method is called with a specific step ID
2. The snapshot is loaded from storage using `loadWorkflowSnapshot()`
3. The snapshot is parsed and prepared for resumption
4. The workflow execution is recreated with the snapshot state
5. The suspended step is resumed, and execution continues

## Storage Options for Snapshots

Mastra provides multiple storage options for persisting snapshots.

A `storage` instance is configured on the `Mastra` class, and is used to setup a snapshot persistence layer for all workflows registered on the `Mastra` instance.
This means that storage is shared across all workflows registered with the same `Mastra` instance.

### LibSQL (Default)

The default storage option is LibSQL, a SQLite-compatible database:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { DefaultStorage } from "@mastra/core/storage/libsql";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new DefaultStorage({
    config: {
      url: "file:storage.db", // Local file-based database
      // For production:
      // url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
      // authToken: process.env.DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN,
    },
  }),
  legacy_workflows: {
    weatherWorkflow,
    travelWorkflow,
  },
});
```

### Upstash (Redis-Compatible)

For serverless environments:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { UpstashStore } from "@mastra/upstash";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new UpstashStore({
    url: process.env.UPSTASH_URL,
    token: process.env.UPSTASH_TOKEN,
  }),
  workflows: {
    weatherWorkflow,
    travelWorkflow,
  },
});
```

## Best Practices for Working with Snapshots

1. **Ensure Serializability**: Any data that needs to be included in the snapshot must be serializable (convertible to JSON).

2. **Minimize Snapshot Size**: Avoid storing large data objects directly in the workflow context. Instead, store references to them (like IDs) and retrieve the data when needed.

3. **Handle Resume Context Carefully**: When resuming a workflow, carefully consider what context to provide. This will be merged with the existing snapshot data.

4. **Set Up Proper Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for suspended workflows, especially long-running ones, to ensure they are properly resumed.

5. **Consider Storage Scaling**: For applications with many suspended workflows, ensure your storage solution is appropriately scaled.

## Advanced Snapshot Patterns

### Custom Snapshot Metadata

When suspending a workflow, you can include custom metadata that can help when resuming:

```typescript
await suspend({
  reason: "Waiting for customer approval",
  requiredApprovers: ["manager", "finance"],
  requestedBy: currentUser,
  urgency: "high",
  expires: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
});
```

This metadata is stored with the snapshot and available when resuming.

### Conditional Resumption

You can implement conditional logic based on the suspend payload when resuming:

```typescript
run.watch(async ({ activePaths }) => {
  const isApprovalStepSuspended =
    activePaths.get("approval")?.status === "suspended";
  if (isApprovalStepSuspended) {
    const payload = activePaths.get("approval")?.suspendPayload;
    if (payload.urgency === "high" && currentUser.role === "manager") {
      await resume({
        stepId: "approval",
        context: { approved: true, approver: currentUser.id },
      });
    }
  }
});
```

title: "Reference: StepCondition | Building Workflows (Legacy) | Mastra"
description: Documentation for the step condition class in workflows, which determines whether a step should execute based on the output of previous steps or trigger data.
---

# StepCondition
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/step-condition

Conditions determine whether a step should execute based on the output of previous steps or trigger data.

## Usage

There are three ways to specify conditions: function, query object, and simple path comparison.

### 1. Function Condition

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
workflow.step(processOrder, {
  when: async ({ context }) => {
    const auth = context?.getStepResult<{ status: string }>("auth");
    return auth?.status === "authenticated";
  },
});
```

### 2. Query Object

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
workflow.step(processOrder, {
  when: {
    ref: { step: "auth", path: "status" },
    query: { $eq: "authenticated" },
  },
});
```

### 3. Simple Path Comparison

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
workflow.step(processOrder, {
  when: {
    "auth.status": "authenticated",
  },
});
```

Based on the type of condition, the workflow runner will try to match the condition to one of these types.

1. Simple Path Condition (when there's a dot in the key)
2. Base/Query Condition (when there's a 'ref' property)
3. Function Condition (when it's an async function)

## StepCondition

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "ref",
      type: "{ stepId: string | 'trigger'; path: string }",
      description:
        "Reference to step output value. stepId can be a step ID or 'trigger' for initial data. path specifies location of value in step result",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "query",
      type: "Query<any>",
      description: "MongoDB-style query using sift operators ($eq, $gt, etc)",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Query

The Query object provides MongoDB-style query operators for comparing values from previous steps or trigger data. It supports basic comparison operators like `$eq`, `$gt`, `$lt` as well as array operators like `$in` and `$nin`, and can be combined with and/or operators for complex conditions.

This query syntax allows for readable conditional logic for determining whether a step should execute.

# Step Retries
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/step-retries

Mastra provides built-in retry mechanisms to handle transient failures in workflow steps. This allows workflows to recover gracefully from temporary issues without requiring manual intervention.

## Overview

When a step in a workflow fails (throws an exception), Mastra can automatically retry the step execution based on a configurable retry policy. This is useful for handling:

- Network connectivity issues
- Service unavailability
- Rate limiting
- Temporary resource constraints
- Other transient failures

## Default Behavior

By default, steps do not retry when they fail. This means:

- A step will execute once
- If it fails, it will immediately mark the step as failed
- The workflow will continue to execute any subsequent steps that don't depend on the failed step

## Configuration Options

Retries can be configured at two levels:

### 1. Workflow-level Configuration

You can set a default retry configuration for all steps in a workflow:

```typescript
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "my-workflow",
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 3, // Number of retries (in addition to the initial attempt)
    delay: 1000, // Delay between retries in milliseconds
  },
});
```

### 2. Step-level Configuration

You can also configure retries on individual steps, which will override the workflow-level configuration for that specific step:

```typescript
const fetchDataStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "fetchData",
  execute: async () => {
    // Fetch data from external API
  },
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 5, // This step will retry up to 5 times
    delay: 2000, // With a 2-second delay between retries
  },
});
```

## Retry Parameters

The `retryConfig` object supports the following parameters:

| Parameter  | Type   | Default | Description                                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `attempts` | number | 0       | The number of retry attempts (in addition to the initial attempt) |
| `delay`    | number | 1000    | Time in milliseconds to wait between retries                      |

## How Retries Work

When a step fails, Mastra's retry mechanism:

1. Checks if the step has retry attempts remaining
2. If attempts remain:
   - Decrements the attempt counter
   - Transitions the step to a "waiting" state
   - Waits for the configured delay period
   - Retries the step execution
3. If no attempts remain or all attempts have been exhausted:
   - Marks the step as "failed"
   - Continues workflow execution (for steps that don't depend on the failed step)

During retry attempts, the workflow execution remains active but paused for the specific step that is being retried.

## Examples

### Basic Retry Example

```typescript
import { LegacyWorkflow, LegacyStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

// Define a step that might fail
const unreliableApiStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "callUnreliableApi",
  execute: async () => {
    // Simulate an API call that might fail
    const random = Math.random();
    if (random < 0.7) {
      throw new Error("API call failed");
    }
    return { data: "API response data" };
  },
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 3, // Retry up to 3 times
    delay: 2000, // Wait 2 seconds between attempts
  },
});

// Create a workflow with the unreliable step
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "retry-demo-workflow",
});

workflow.step(unreliableApiStep).then(processResultStep).commit();
```

### Workflow-level Retries with Step Override

```typescript
import { LegacyWorkflow, LegacyStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows/legacy";

// Create a workflow with default retry configuration
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "multi-retry-workflow",
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 2, // All steps will retry twice by default
    delay: 1000, // With a 1-second delay
  },
});

// This step uses the workflow's default retry configuration
const standardStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "standardStep",
  execute: async () => {
    // Some operation that might fail
  },
});

// This step overrides the workflow's retry configuration
const criticalStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "criticalStep",
  execute: async () => {
    // Critical operation that needs more retry attempts
  },
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 5, // Override with 5 retry attempts
    delay: 5000, // And a longer 5-second delay
  },
});

// This step disables retries
const noRetryStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "noRetryStep",
  execute: async () => {
    // Operation that should not retry
  },
  retryConfig: {
    attempts: 0, // Explicitly disable retries
  },
});

workflow.step(standardStep).then(criticalStep).then(noRetryStep).commit();
```

## Monitoring Retries

You can monitor retry attempts in your logs. Mastra logs retry-related events at the `debug` level:

```
[DEBUG] Step fetchData failed (runId: abc-123)
[DEBUG] Attempt count for step fetchData: 2 remaining attempts (runId: abc-123)
[DEBUG] Step fetchData waiting (runId: abc-123)
[DEBUG] Step fetchData finished waiting (runId: abc-123)
[DEBUG] Step fetchData pending (runId: abc-123)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Retries for Transient Failures**: Only configure retries for operations that might experience transient failures. For deterministic errors (like validation failures), retries won't help.

2. **Set Appropriate Delays**: Consider using longer delays for external API calls to allow time for services to recover.

3. **Limit Retry Attempts**: Don't set extremely high retry counts as this could cause workflows to run for excessive periods during outages.

4. **Implement Idempotent Operations**: Ensure your step's `execute` function is idempotent (can be called multiple times without side effects) since it may be retried.

5. **Consider Backoff Strategies**: For more advanced scenarios, consider implementing exponential backoff in your step's logic for operations that might be rate-limited.

title: "Reference: suspend() | Control Flow | Mastra Docs"
description: "Documentation for the suspend function in Mastra workflows, which pauses execution until resumed."
---

# suspend()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/suspend

Pauses workflow execution at the current step until explicitly resumed. The workflow state is persisted and can be continued later.

## Usage Example

```typescript
const approvalStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "needsApproval",
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    if (context.steps.amount > 1000) {
      await suspend();
    }
    return { approved: true };
  },
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "metadata",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      description: "Optional data to store with the suspended state",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "Promise<void>",
      type: "Promise",
      description: "Resolves when the workflow is successfully suspended",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Additional Examples

Suspend with metadata:

```typescript
const reviewStep = new LegacyStep({
  id: "review",
  execute: async ({ context, suspend }) => {
    await suspend({
      reason: "Needs manager approval",
      requestedBy: context.user,
    });
    return { reviewed: true };
  },
});

title: "Reference: Workflow.then() | Building Workflows (Legacy) | Mastra Docs"
description: Documentation for the `.then()` method in workflows, which creates sequential dependencies between steps.
---

# Workflow.then()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/then

The `.then()` method creates a sequential dependency between workflow steps, ensuring steps execute in a specific order.

## Usage

```typescript
workflow.step(stepOne).then(stepTwo).then(stepThree);
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "step",
      type: "Step | string",
      description:
        "The step instance or step ID that should execute after the previous step completes",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "workflow",
      type: "LegacyWorkflow",
      description: "The workflow instance for method chaining",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Validation

When using `then`:

- The previous step must exist in the workflow
- Steps cannot form circular dependencies
- Each step can only appear once in a sequential chain

## Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  workflow
    .step(stepA)
    .then(stepB)
    .then(stepA) // Will throw error - circular dependency
    .commit();
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    console.log(error.type); // 'circular_dependency'
    console.log(error.details);
  }
}
```

title: "Reference: Workflow.until() | Looping in Workflows (Legacy) | Mastra Docs"
description: "Documentation for the `.until()` method in Mastra workflows, which repeats a step until a specified condition becomes true."
---

# Workflow.until()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/legacyWorkflows/until

The `.until()` method repeats a step until a specified condition becomes true. This creates a loop that continues executing the specified step until the condition is satisfied.

## Usage

```typescript
workflow.step(incrementStep).until(condition, incrementStep).then(finalStep);
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "condition",
      type: "Function | ReferenceCondition",
      description:
        "A function or reference condition that determines when to stop looping",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "step",
      type: "Step",
      description: "The step to repeat until the condition is met",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Condition Types

### Function Condition

You can use a function that returns a boolean:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(incrementStep)
  .until(async ({ context }) => {
    const result = context.getStepResult<{ value: number }>("increment");
    return (result?.value ?? 0) >= 10; // Stop when value reaches or exceeds 10
  }, incrementStep)
  .then(finalStep);
```

### Reference Condition

You can use a reference-based condition with comparison operators:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(incrementStep)
  .until(
    {
      ref: { step: incrementStep, path: "value" },
      query: { $gte: 10 }, // Stop when value is greater than or equal to 10
    },
    incrementStep,
  )
  .then(finalStep);
```

## Comparison Operators

When using reference-based conditions, you can use these comparison operators:

| Operator | Description              | Example        |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| `$eq`    | Equal to                 | `{ $eq: 10 }`  |
| `$ne`    | Not equal to             | `{ $ne: 0 }`   |
| `$gt`    | Greater than             | `{ $gt: 5 }`   |
| `$gte`   | Greater than or equal to | `{ $gte: 10 }` |
| `$lt`    | Less than                | `{ $lt: 20 }`  |
| `$lte`   | Less than or equal to    | `{ $lte: 15 }` |

    const currentValue =
      context.getStepResult<{ value: number }>("increment")?.value ?? 0;
    return currentValue >= targetValue;
  }, incrementStep)
  .then(finalStep)
  .commit();

// Execute the workflow
const run = counterWorkflow.createRun();
const result = await run.start({
  triggerData: { startValue: 0, targetValue: 5 },
});
// Will increment from 0 to 5, then stop and execute finalStep

## Condition Types

### Function Condition

You can use a function that returns a boolean:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(incrementStep)
  .while(async ({ context }) => {
    const result = context.getStepResult<{ value: number }>("increment");
    return (result?.value ?? 0) < 10; // Continue as long as value is less than 10
  }, incrementStep)
  .then(finalStep);
```

### Reference Condition

You can use a reference-based condition with comparison operators:

```typescript
workflow
  .step(incrementStep)
  .while(
    {
      ref: { step: incrementStep, path: "value" },
      query: { $lt: 10 }, // Continue as long as value is less than 10
    },
    incrementStep,
  )
  .then(finalStep);
```

## Comparison Operators

When using reference-based conditions, you can use these comparison operators:

| Operator | Description              | Example        |

      type: "z.Schema",
      description: "Optional schema for validating workflow trigger data",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Core Methods

#### `step()`

Adds a [Step](./step-class.mdx) to the workflow, including transitions to other steps. Returns the workflow instance for chaining. [Learn more about steps](./step-class.mdx).

#### `commit()`

Validates and finalizes the workflow configuration. Must be called after adding all steps.

#### `execute()`

Executes the workflow with optional trigger data. Typed based on the [trigger schema](./workflow.mdx#trigger-schemas).

## Trigger Schemas

Trigger schemas validate the initial data passed to a workflow using Zod.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const workflow = new LegacyWorkflow({
  name: "order-process",
  triggerSchema: z.object({
    orderId: z.string(),
    customer: z.object({
      id: z.string(),
      email: z.string().email(),
    }),
  }),
});
```

The schema:

- Validates data passed to `execute()`
- Provides TypeScript types for your workflow input

## Validation

Workflow validation happens at two key times:

### 1. At Commit Time

When you call `.commit()`, the workflow validates:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
workflow
  .step('step1', {...})
  .step('step2', {...})
  .commit(); // Validates workflow structure
```

- Circular dependencies between steps
- Terminal paths (every path must end)
- Unreachable steps
- Variable references to non-existent steps
- Duplicate step IDs

### 2. During Execution

When you call `start()`, it validates:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
const { runId, start } = workflow.createRun();

// Validates trigger data against schema
await start({
  triggerData: {
    orderId: "123",
    customer: {
      id: "cust_123",
      email: "invalid-email", // Will fail validation
    },
  },
});
```

- Trigger data against trigger schema
- Each step's input data against its inputSchema
- Variable paths exist in referenced step outputs
- Required variables are present

## Workflow Status

A workflow's status indicates its current execution state. The possible values are:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "CREATED",
      type: "string",
      description: "Workflow instance has been created but not started",
    },
    {
      name: "RUNNING",
      type: "string",
      description: "Workflow is actively executing steps",
    },
    {
      name: "SUSPENDED",
      type: "string",
      description: "Workflow execution is paused waiting for resume",
    },
    {
      name: "COMPLETED",
      type: "string",
      description: "All steps finished executing successfully",
    },
    {
      name: "FAILED",
      type: "string",
      description: "Workflow encountered an error during execution",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Example: Handling Different Statuses

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const { runId, start, watch } = workflow.createRun();

watch(async ({ status }) => {
  switch (status) {
    case "SUSPENDED":
      // Handle suspended state
      break;
    case "COMPLETED":
      // Process results
      break;
    case "FAILED":
      // Handle error state
      break;
  }
});

await start({ triggerData: data });
```

## Error Handling

```ts showLineNumbers copy
try {
  const { runId, start, watch, resume } = workflow.createRun();
  await start({ triggerData: data });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    // Handle validation errors
    console.log(error.type); // 'circular_dependency' | 'no_terminal_path' | 'unreachable_step'
    console.log(error.details); // { stepId?: string, path?: string[] }
  }
}
```

## Passing Context Between Steps

Steps can access data from previous steps in the workflow through the context object. Each step receives the accumulated context from all previous steps that have executed.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
workflow
  .step({
    id: "getData",
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      return {
        data: { id: "123", value: "example" },
      };
    },
  })
  .step({
    id: "processData",
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      // Access data from previous step through context.steps
      const previousData = context.steps.getData.output.data;
      // Process previousData.id and previousData.value
    },
  });
```

The context object:

- Contains results from all completed steps in `context.steps`
- Provides access to step outputs through `context.steps.[stepId].output`
- Is typed based on step output schemas
- Is immutable to ensure data consistency

title: "AgentNetwork (Experimental)"
description: "Reference documentation for the AgentNetwork class"
---

# AgentNetwork (Experimental)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/networks/agent-network

> **Note:** The AgentNetwork feature is experimental and may change in future releases.

The `AgentNetwork` class provides a way to create a network of specialized agents that can collaborate to solve complex tasks. Unlike Workflows, which require explicit control over execution paths, AgentNetwork uses an LLM-based router to dynamically determine which agent to call next.

## Key Concepts

- **LLM-based Routing**: AgentNetwork exclusively uses an LLM to figure out the best way to use your agents
- **Agent Collaboration**: Multiple specialized agents can work together to solve complex tasks
- **Dynamic Decision Making**: The router decides which agent to call based on the task requirements

## Usage

```typescript
import { AgentNetwork } from "@mastra/core/network";
import { openai } from "@mastra/openai";

// Create specialized agents
const webSearchAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Web Search Agent",
  instructions: "You search the web for information.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools: {
    /* web search tools */
  },
});

const dataAnalysisAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Data Analysis Agent",
  instructions: "You analyze data and provide insights.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  tools: {
    /* data analysis tools */
  },
});

// Create the network
const researchNetwork = new AgentNetwork({
  name: "Research Network",
  instructions: "Coordinate specialized agents to research topics thoroughly.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  agents: [webSearchAgent, dataAnalysisAgent],
});

// Use the network
const result = await researchNetwork.generate(
  "Research the impact of climate change on agriculture",
);
console.log(result.text);
```

## Constructor

```typescript
constructor(config: AgentNetworkConfig)
```

### Parameters

- `config`: Configuration object for the AgentNetwork
  - `name`: Name of the network
  - `instructions`: Instructions for the routing agent
  - `model`: Language model to use for routing
  - `agents`: Array of specialized agents in the network

## Methods

### generate()

Generates a response using the agent network. This method has replaced the deprecated `run()` method for consistency with the rest of the codebase.

```typescript
async generate(
  messages: string | string[] | CoreMessage[],
  args?: AgentGenerateOptions
): Promise<GenerateTextResult>
```

### stream()

Streams a response using the agent network.

```typescript
async stream(
  messages: string | string[] | CoreMessage[],
  args?: AgentStreamOptions
): Promise<StreamTextResult>
```

### getRoutingAgent()

Returns the routing agent used by the network.

```typescript
getRoutingAgent(): Agent
```

### getAgents()

Returns the array of specialized agents in the network.

```typescript
getAgents(): Agent[]
```

### getAgentHistory()

Returns the history of interactions for a specific agent.

```typescript
getAgentHistory(agentId: string): Array<{
  input: string;
  output: string;
  timestamp: string;
}>
```

### getAgentInteractionHistory()

Returns the history of all agent interactions that have occurred in the network.

```typescript
getAgentInteractionHistory(): Record<
  string,
  Array<{
    input: string;
    output: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }>
>
```

### getAgentInteractionSummary()

Returns a formatted summary of agent interactions in chronological order.

```typescript
getAgentInteractionSummary(): string
```

## When to Use AgentNetwork vs Workflows

- **Use AgentNetwork when:** You want the AI to figure out the best way to use your agents, with dynamic routing based on the task requirements.

- **Use Workflows when:** You need explicit control over execution paths, with predetermined sequences of agent calls and conditional logic.

## Internal Tools

The AgentNetwork uses a special `transmit` tool that allows the routing agent to call specialized agents. This tool handles:

- Single agent calls
- Multiple parallel agent calls
- Context sharing between agents

## Limitations

- The AgentNetwork approach may use more tokens than a well-designed Workflow for the same task
- Debugging can be more challenging as the routing decisions are made by the LLM
- Performance may vary based on the quality of the routing instructions and the capabilities of the specialized agents

description: Documentation for Logger instances, which provide methods to record events at various severity levels.
---

# Logger Instance
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/observability/logger

A Logger instance is created by `new PinoLogger()` and provides methods to record events at various severity levels. Depending on the logger type, messages may be written to the console, file, or an external service.

## Example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
// Using a console logger
const logger = new PinoLogger({ name: "Mastra", level: "info" });

logger.debug("Debug message"); // Won't be logged because level is INFO
logger.info({
  message: "User action occurred",
  destinationPath: "user-actions",
  type: "AGENT",
}); // Logged
logger.error("An error occurred"); // Logged as ERROR
```

## Methods

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "debug",
      type: "(message: BaseLogMessage | string, ...args: any[]) => void | Promise<void>",
      description: "Write a DEBUG-level log. Only recorded if level ≤ DEBUG.",
    },
    {
      name: "info",
      type: "(message: BaseLogMessage | string, ...args: any[]) => void | Promise<void>",
      description: "Write an INFO-level log. Only recorded if level ≤ INFO.",
    },
    {
      name: "warn",
      type: "(message: BaseLogMessage | string, ...args: any[]) => void | Promise<void>",
      description: "Write a WARN-level log. Only recorded if level ≤ WARN.",
    },
    {
      name: "error",
      type: "(message: BaseLogMessage | string, ...args: any[]) => void | Promise<void>",
      description: "Write an ERROR-level log. Only recorded if level ≤ ERROR.",
    },
    {
      name: "cleanup",
      type: "() => Promise<void>",
      isOptional: true,
      description:
        "Cleanup resources held by the logger (e.g., network connections for Upstash). Not all loggers implement this.",
    },
  ]}
/>

**Note:** Some loggers require a `BaseLogMessage` object (with `message`, `destinationPath`, `type` fields). For instance, the `File` and `Upstash` loggers need structured messages.

## File Transport (Structured Logs)

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
import { FileTransport } from "@mastra/loggers/file";

const fileLogger = new PinoLogger({
  name: "Mastra",
  transports: { file: new FileTransport({ path: "test-dir/test.log" }) },
  level: "warn",
});

fileLogger.warn("Low disk space", {
  destinationPath: "system",
  type: "WORKFLOW",
});
```

## Upstash Logger (Remote Log Drain)

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
import { UpstashTransport } from "@mastra/loggers/upstash";

const logger = new PinoLogger({
  name: "Mastra",
  transports: {
    upstash: new UpstashTransport({
      listName: "production-logs",
      upstashUrl: process.env.UPSTASH_URL!,
      upstashToken: process.env.UPSTASH_TOKEN!,
    }),
  },
  level: "info",
});

logger.info({
  message: "User signed in",
  destinationPath: "auth",
  type: "AGENT",
  runId: "run_123",
});
```

## Custom Transport

You can create custom transports using the `createCustomTransport` utility to integrate with any logging service or stream.

### Example: Sentry Integration

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
import { createCustomTransport } from "@mastra/core/loggers";
import pinoSentry from 'pino-sentry-transport';

const sentryStream = await pinoSentry({
  sentry: {
    dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
    _experiments: {
      enableLogs: true,
    },
  },
});

const customTransport = createCustomTransport(sentryStream);

const logger = new PinoLogger({
  name: "Mastra",
  transports: { sentry: customTransport },
  level: "info",
});
```

# `OtelConfig`
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/observability/otel-config

The `OtelConfig` object is used to configure OpenTelemetry instrumentation, tracing, and exporting behavior within your application. By adjusting its properties, you can control how telemetry data (such as traces) is collected, sampled, and exported.

To use the `OtelConfig` within Mastra, pass it as the value of the `telemetry` key when initializing Mastra. This will configure Mastra to use your custom OpenTelemetry settings for tracing and instrumentation.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "mastra";

const otelConfig: OtelConfig = {
  serviceName: "my-awesome-service",
  enabled: true,
  sampling: {
    type: "ratio",
    probability: 0.5,
  },
  export: {
    type: "otlp",
    endpoint: "https://otel-collector.example.com/v1/traces",
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
    },

To help you get started quickly, we’ve provided a pre-built example. You can find the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/Keywords-AI/keywordsai-example-projects/tree/main/mastra-ai-weather-agent).


## Setup

Here's the tutorial about the Mastra Weather Agent example.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash copy
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and add your API keys:

```bash copy
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Update .env.local with your credentials: 

```bash .env.local copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
KEYWORDSAI_API_KEY=your-keywordsai-api-key
KEYWORDSAI_BASE_URL=https://api.keywordsai.co
```

### 3. Setup Mastra client with Keywords AI tracing

Configure with KeywordsAI telemetry in `src/mastra/index.ts`:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy

import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { KeywordsAIExporter } from "@keywordsai/exporter-vercel";

telemetry: {
  serviceName: "keywordai-mastra-example",
  enabled: true,
  export: {
    type: "custom",
    exporter: new KeywordsAIExporter({
      apiKey: process.env.KEYWORDSAI_API_KEY,
      baseUrl: process.env.KEYWORDSAI_BASE_URL,
      debug: true,
    })
  }
}
```

### 3. Run the Project

```bash copy

# Langfuse
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/observability/providers/langfuse

Langfuse is an open-source observability platform designed specifically for LLM applications.

> **Note**: Currently, only AI-related calls will contain detailed telemetry data. Other operations will create traces but with limited information.

## Configuration

To use Langfuse with Mastra, you'll need to configure the following environment variables:

```env
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
LANGFUSE_BASEURL=https://cloud.langfuse.com  # Optional - defaults to cloud.langfuse.com
```

**Important**: When configuring the telemetry export settings, the `traceName` parameter must be set to `"ai"` for the Langfuse integration to work properly.

## Implementation

Here's how to configure Mastra to use Langfuse:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { LangfuseExporter } from "langfuse-vercel";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "ai", // this must be set to "ai" so that the LangfuseExporter thinks it's an AI SDK trace
    enabled: true,
    export: {
      type: "custom",
      exporter: new LangfuseExporter({
        publicKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY,
        secretKey: process.env.LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY,
        baseUrl: process.env.LANGFUSE_BASEURL,
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

LangSmith is LangChain's platform for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring LLM applications.

> **Note**: Currently, this integration only traces AI-related calls in your application. Other types of operations are not captured in the telemetry data.

## Configuration

To use LangSmith with Mastra, you'll need to configure the following environment variables:

```env
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-api-key
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=your-project-name
```

## Implementation

Here's how to configure Mastra to use LangSmith:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { AISDKExporter } from "langsmith/vercel";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  telemetry: {
    serviceName: "your-service-name",
    enabled: true,
    export: {
      type: "custom",
      exporter: new AISDKExporter(),
    },
  },
});
```

## Dashboard

Access your traces and analytics in the LangSmith dashboard at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com)

> **Note**: Even if you run your workflows, you may not see data appearing in a new project. You will need to sort by Name column to see all projects, select your project, then filter by LLM Calls instead of Root Runs.

# Reference: .chunk()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/rag/chunk

The `.chunk()` function splits documents into smaller segments using various strategies and options.

## Example

```typescript
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";

const doc = MDocument.fromMarkdown(`
# Introduction
This is a sample document that we want to split into chunks.

## Section 1
Here is the first section with some content.

## Section 2 
Here is another section with different content.
`);

// Basic chunking with defaults
const chunks = await doc.chunk();

// Markdown-specific chunking with header extraction
const chunksWithMetadata = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "markdown",
  headers: [
    ["#", "title"],
    ["##", "section"],
  ],
  extract: {
    summary: true, // Extract summaries with default settings
    keywords: true, // Extract keywords with default settings
  },
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable

      description:
        "Metadata extraction configuration. See [ExtractParams reference](./extract-params) for details.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Strategy-Specific Options

Strategy-specific options are passed as top-level parameters alongside the strategy parameter. For example:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
// HTML strategy example
const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "html",
  headers: [
    ["h1", "title"],
    ["h2", "subtitle"],
  ], // HTML-specific option
  sections: [["div.content", "main"]], // HTML-specific option
  size: 500, // general option
});

// Markdown strategy example
const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "markdown",
  headers: [
    ["#", "title"],
    ["##", "section"],
  ], // Markdown-specific option
  stripHeaders: true, // Markdown-specific option
  overlap: 50, // general option
});

// Token strategy example
const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  strategy: "token",
  encodingName: "gpt2", // Token-specific option
  modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo", // Token-specific option
  size: 1000, // general option
});
```

The options documented below are passed directly at the top level of the configuration object, not nested within a separate options object.

# Couchbase Vector Store
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/rag/couchbase

The `CouchbaseVector` class provides vector search using [Couchbase Vector Search](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/vector-search/vector-search.html). It enables efficient similarity search and metadata filtering within your Couchbase collections.

## Requirements

- **Couchbase Server 7.6.4+** or a compatible Capella cluster
- **Search Service enabled** on your Couchbase deployment

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/couchbase
```

## Usage Example

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { CouchbaseVector } from '@mastra/couchbase';

const store = new CouchbaseVector({
  connectionString: process.env.COUCHBASE_CONNECTION_STRING,
  username: process.env.COUCHBASE_USERNAME,
  password: process.env.COUCHBASE_PASSWORD,
  bucketName: process.env.COUCHBASE_BUCKET,
  scopeName: process.env.COUCHBASE_SCOPE,
  collectionName: process.env.COUCHBASE_COLLECTION,
});
```

## Constructor Options

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "connectionString",
      type: "string",
      description: "Couchbase connection string",
    },

  ]}
/>

## Methods

### createIndex()

Creates a new vector index in Couchbase.

> **Note:** Index creation is asynchronous. After calling `createIndex`, allow time (typically 1–5 seconds for small datasets, longer for large ones) before querying. For production, implement polling to check index status rather than using fixed delays.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the index to create",
    },
    {
      name: "dimension",
      type: "number",
      description: "Vector dimension (must match your embedding model)",
    },
    {
      name: "metric",
      type: "'cosine' | 'euclidean' | 'dotproduct'",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "cosine",
      description: "Distance metric for similarity search",
    },
  ]}
/>

### upsert()

Adds or updates vectors and their metadata in the collection.

> **Note:** You can upsert data before or after creating the index. The `upsert` method does not require the index to exist. Couchbase allows multiple Search indexes over the same collection.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the index to insert into",
    },
    {
      name: "vectors",
      type: "number[][]",
      description: "Array of embedding vectors",
    },
    {
      name: "metadata",
      type: "Record<string, any>[]",
      isOptional: true,
      description: "Metadata for each vector",
    },
    {
      name: "ids",
      type: "string[]",
      isOptional: true,
      description: "Optional vector IDs (auto-generated if not provided)",
    },
  ]}
/>

### query()

Searches for similar vectors.

> **Warning:** The `filter` and `includeVector` parameters are not currently supported. Filtering must be performed client-side after retrieving results, or by using the Couchbase SDK's Search capabilities directly. To retrieve the vector embedding, fetch the full document by ID using the Couchbase SDK.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the index to search in",
    },
    {
      name: "queryVector",
      type: "number[]",
      description: "Query vector to find similar vectors for",
    },
    {
      name: "topK",
      type: "number",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "10",
      description: "Number of results to return",
    },
    {
      name: "filter",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      isOptional: true,
      description: "Metadata filters",
    },
    {
      name: "includeVector",
      type: "boolean",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "false",
      description: "Whether to include vector data in results",
    },
    {
      name: "minScore",
      type: "number",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "0",
      description: "Minimum similarity score threshold",
    },
  ]}
/>

### describeIndex()

Returns information about the index.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the index to describe",
    },
  ]}
/>

Returns:

```typescript copy
interface IndexStats {
  dimension: number;
  count: number;
  metric: "cosine" | "euclidean" | "dotproduct";
}
```

### deleteIndex()

Deletes an index and all its data.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the index to delete",
    },
  ]}
/>

### listIndexes()

Lists all vector indexes in the Couchbase bucket.

Returns: `Promise<string[]>`

### updateVector()

Updates a specific vector entry by its ID with new vector data and/or metadata.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the index containing the vector",
    },
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "ID of the vector entry to update",
    },
    {
      name: "update",
      type: "object",
      description: "Update data containing vector and/or metadata",
    },
    {
      name: "update.vector",
      type: "number[]",
      isOptional: true,
      description: "New vector data to update",
    },
    {

      isOptional: true,
      description: "New metadata to update",
    },
  ]}
/>

### deleteVector()

Deletes a specific vector entry from an index by its ID.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",

      description: "Name of the index containing the vector",
    },
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "ID of the vector entry to delete",
    },
  ]}
/>

### disconnect()

Closes the Couchbase client connection. Should be called when done using the store.

## Response Types

Query results are returned in this format:

```typescript copy
interface QueryResult {
  id: string;
  score: number;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  vector?: number[]; // Only included if includeVector is true
}
```

## Error Handling

The store throws typed errors that can be caught:

```typescript copy
try {
  await store.query({
    indexName: "my_index",
    queryVector: queryVector,
  });
} catch (error) {
  // Handle specific error cases
  if (error.message.includes("Invalid index name")) {
    console.error(
      "Index name must start with a letter or underscore and contain only valid characters."
    );
  } else if (error.message.includes("Index not found")) {
    console.error("The specified index does not exist");
  } else {
    console.error("Vector store error:", error.message);
  }
}
```

## Notes

- **Index Deletion Caveat:** Deleting a Search index does NOT delete the vectors/documents in the associated Couchbase collection. Data remains unless explicitly removed.
- **Required Permissions:** The Couchbase user must have permissions to connect, read/write documents in the target collection (`kv` role), and manage Search Indexes (`search_admin` role on the relevant bucket/scope).
- **Index Definition Details & Document Structure:** The `createIndex` method constructs a Search Index definition that indexes the `embedding` field (as type `vector`) and the `content` field (as type `text`), targeting documents within the specified `scopeName.collectionName`. Each document stores the vector in the `embedding` field and metadata in the `metadata` field. If `metadata` contains a `text` property, its value is also copied to a top-level `content` field, which is indexed for text search.
- **Replication & Durability:** Consider using Couchbase's built-in replication and persistence features for data durability. Monitor index statistics regularly to ensure efficient search.

## Limitations

- Index creation delays may impact immediate querying after creation.
- No hard enforcement of vector dimension at ingest time (dimension mismatches will error at query time).
- Vector insertion and index updates are eventually consistent; strong consistency is not guaranteed immediately after writes.

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";
import { Tabs } from "nextra/components";

# DatabaseConfig
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/rag/database-config

The `DatabaseConfig` type allows you to specify database-specific configurations when using vector query tools. These configurations enable you to leverage unique features and optimizations offered by different vector stores.

## Type Definition

```typescript
export type DatabaseConfig = {
  pinecone?: PineconeConfig;
  pgvector?: PgVectorConfig;
  chroma?: ChromaConfig;
  [key: string]: any; // Extensible for future databases
};
```

## Database-Specific Types

### PineconeConfig

Configuration options specific to Pinecone vector store.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "namespace",
      type: "string",
      description: "Pinecone namespace for organizing and isolating vectors within the same index. Useful for multi-tenancy or environment separation.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "sparseVector",
      type: "{ indices: number[]; values: number[]; }",
      description: "Sparse vector for hybrid search combining dense and sparse embeddings. Enables better search quality for keyword-based queries.  The indices and values arrays must be the same length.",
      isOptional: true,
      properties: [
        {
          type: "object",
          parameters: [
            {
              name: "indices",
              description: "Array of indices for sparse vector components",
              isOptional: false,
              type: "number[]",
            },
            {
              name: "values",
              description: "Array of values corresponding to the indices",
              isOptional: false,
              type: "number[]",
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-tenant applications (separate namespaces per tenant)
- Environment isolation (dev/staging/prod namespaces)
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching

### PgVectorConfig

Configuration options specific to PostgreSQL with pgvector extension.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "minScore",
      type: "number",
      description: "Minimum similarity score threshold for results. Only vectors with similarity scores above this value will be returned.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "ef",
      type: "number",
      description: "HNSW search parameter that controls the size of the dynamic candidate list during search. Higher values improve accuracy at the cost of speed. Typically set between topK and 200.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "probes",
      type: "number",
      description: "IVFFlat probe parameter that specifies the number of index cells to visit during search. Higher values improve recall at the cost of speed.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

**Performance Guidelines:**
- **ef**: Start with 2-4x your topK value, increase for better accuracy
- **probes**: Start with 1-10, increase for better recall
- **minScore**: Use values between 0.5-0.9 depending on your quality requirements

**Use Cases:**
- Performance optimization for high-load scenarios
- Quality filtering to remove irrelevant results
- Fine-tuning search accuracy vs speed tradeoffs

### ChromaConfig

Configuration options specific to Chroma vector store.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "where",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      description: "Metadata filtering conditions using MongoDB-style query syntax. Filters results based on metadata fields.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "whereDocument",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      description: "Document content filtering conditions. Allows filtering based on the actual document text content.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

**Filter Syntax Examples:**
```typescript
// Simple equality
where: { "category": "technical" }

// Operators
where: { "price": { "$gt": 100 } }

// Multiple conditions
where: { 
  "category": "electronics",
  "inStock": true 
}

// Document content filtering
whereDocument: { "$contains": "API documentation" }
```

**Use Cases:**
- Advanced metadata filtering
- Content-based document filtering
- Complex query combinations

      model: embedModel,
      databaseConfig: {
        pinecone: {
          namespace: 'development'
        }
      }
    });
    
    // Override at runtime
    const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
    runtimeContext.set('databaseConfig', {
      pinecone: {
        namespace: 'production'
      }
    });

      mastra,
      runtimeContext
    });
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Multi-Database Configuration

    ```typescript
    const vectorTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: 'dynamic', // Will be determined at runtime
      indexName: 'documents',
      model: embedModel,
      databaseConfig: {
        pinecone: {
          namespace: 'default'
        },
        pgvector: {
          minScore: 0.8,
          ef: 150
        },

    </Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Performance Tuning

    ```typescript
    // High accuracy configuration
    const highAccuracyTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: 'postgres',
      indexName: 'embeddings',
      model: embedModel,
      databaseConfig: {
        pgvector: {
          ef: 400,        // High accuracy
          probes: 20,     // High recall
          minScore: 0.85  // High quality threshold
        }
      }
    });
    
    // High speed configuration  
    const highSpeedTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: 'postgres',
      indexName: 'embeddings',
      model: embedModel,
      databaseConfig: {
        pgvector: {
          ef: 50,         // Lower accuracy, faster
          probes: 3,      // Lower recall, faster
          minScore: 0.6   // Lower quality threshold
        }
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Extensibility

The `DatabaseConfig` type is designed to be extensible. To add support for a new vector database:

```typescript
// 1. Define the configuration interface
export interface NewDatabaseConfig {
  customParam1?: string;
  customParam2?: number;
}

// 2. Extend DatabaseConfig type
export type DatabaseConfig = {
  pinecone?: PineconeConfig;
  pgvector?: PgVectorConfig;
  chroma?: ChromaConfig;
  newdatabase?: NewDatabaseConfig;
  [key: string]: any;
};

// 3. Use in vector query tool
const vectorTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: 'newdatabase',
  indexName: 'documents',
  model: embedModel,
  databaseConfig: {
    newdatabase: {
      customParam1: 'value',
      customParam2: 42
    }
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Configuration**: Use different namespaces or configurations for different environments
2. **Performance Tuning**: Start with default values and adjust based on your specific needs
3. **Quality Filtering**: Use minScore to filter out low-quality results
4. **Runtime Flexibility**: Override configurations at runtime for dynamic scenarios
5. **Documentation**: Document your specific configuration choices for team members

## Migration Guide

Existing vector query tools continue to work without changes. To add database configurations:

```diff
const vectorTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: 'pinecone',
  indexName: 'documents',
  model: embedModel,
+ databaseConfig: {
+   pinecone: {
+     namespace: 'production'
+   }
+ }
});
```

# Embed
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/rag/embeddings

Mastra uses the AI SDK's `embed` and `embedMany` functions to generate vector embeddings for text inputs, enabling similarity search and RAG workflows.

## Single Embedding

The `embed` function generates a vector embedding for a single text input:

```typescript
import { embed } from "ai";

const result = await embed({
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  value: "Your text to embed",
  maxRetries: 2, // optional, defaults to 2
});
```

### Parameters

// }
```

## Document Grouping for Title Extraction

When using the `TitleExtractor`, you can group multiple chunks together for title extraction by specifying a shared `docId` in the `metadata` field of each chunk. All chunks with the same `docId` will receive the same extracted title. If no `docId` is set, each chunk is treated as its own document for title extraction.

**Example:**

```ts
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";

const doc = new MDocument({
  docs: [
    { text: "chunk 1", metadata: { docId: "docA" } },
    { text: "chunk 2", metadata: { docId: "docA" } },
    { text: "chunk 3", metadata: { docId: "docB" } },
  ],
  type: "text",
});

await doc.extractMetadata({ title: true });
// The first two chunks will share a title, while the third chunk will be assigned a separate title.
```

# GraphRAG
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/rag/graph-rag

The `GraphRAG` class implements a graph-based approach to retrieval augmented generation. It creates a knowledge graph from document chunks where nodes represent documents and edges represent semantic relationships, enabling both direct similarity matching and discovery of related content through graph traversal.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { GraphRAG } from "@mastra/rag";

const graphRag = new GraphRAG({
  dimension: 1536,
  threshold: 0.7,
});

// Create the graph from chunks and embeddings
graphRag.createGraph(documentChunks, embeddings);

// Query the graph with embedding
const results = await graphRag.query({
  query: queryEmbedding,
  topK: 10,
  randomWalkSteps: 100,
  restartProb: 0.15,
});
```

## Constructor Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[

      type: "number",
      description: "Dimension of the embedding vectors",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "1536",
    },
    {
      name: "threshold",
      type: "number",
      description:
        "Similarity threshold for creating edges between nodes (0-1)",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "0.7",
    },
  ]}
/>

# Lance Vector Store
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/rag/lance

The LanceVectorStore class provides vector search using [LanceDB](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/), an embedded vector database built on the Lance columnar format. It offers efficient storage and fast similarity search for both local development and production deployments.

## Factory Method

The LanceVectorStore uses a factory pattern for creation. You should use the static `create()` method rather than the constructor directly.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "uri",
      type: "string",
      description: "Path to LanceDB database or URI for cloud deployments",
    },
    {
      name: "options",
      type: "ConnectionOptions",
      description:
        "Additional connection options for LanceDB",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Constructor Examples

You can create a `LanceVectorStore` instance using the static create method:

```ts
import { LanceVectorStore } from "@mastra/lance";

// Connect to a local database
const vectorStore = await LanceVectorStore.create("/path/to/db");

// Connect to a LanceDB cloud database
const cloudStore = await LanceVectorStore.create("db://host:port");

// Connect to a cloud database with options
const s3Store = await LanceVectorStore.create("s3://bucket/db", { 
  storageOptions: { timeout: '60s' }
});
```

  document?: string; // Document text if available
}
```

## Error Handling

The store throws typed errors that can be caught:

```typescript copy
try {
  await store.query({
    tableName: "my_vectors",
    queryVector: queryVector,
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    console.log(error.message);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use the appropriate index type for your use case:
  - HNSW for better recall and performance when memory isn't constrained
  - IVF for better memory efficiency with large datasets
- For optimal performance with large datasets, consider adjusting `numPartitions` and `numSubVectors` values
- Use `close()` method to properly close connections when done with the database
- Store metadata with a consistent schema to simplify filtering operations

# LibSQLVector Store
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/rag/libsql

The LibSQL storage implementation provides a SQLite-compatible vector search [LibSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql), a fork of SQLite with vector extensions, and [Turso](https://turso.tech/) with vector extensions, offering a lightweight and efficient vector database solution.
It's part of the `@mastra/libsql` package and offers efficient vector similarity search with metadata filtering.

## Installation

Default vector store is included in the core package:

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/libsql@latest
```

## Usage

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { LibSQLVector } from "@mastra/libsql";

// Create a new vector store instance
const store = new LibSQLVector({
  connectionUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  // Optional: for Turso cloud databases
  authToken: process.env.DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN,
});

// Create an index
await store.createIndex({
  indexName: "myCollection",
  dimension: 1536,
});

// Add vectors with metadata
const vectors = [[0.1, 0.2, ...], [0.3, 0.4, ...]];
const metadata = [
  { text: "first document", category: "A" },
  { text: "second document", category: "B" }
];
await store.upsert({
  indexName: "myCollection",
  vectors,
  metadata,
});

// Query similar vectors
const queryVector = [0.1, 0.2, ...];
const results = await store.query({
  indexName: "myCollection",
  queryVector,
  topK: 10, // top K results
  filter: { category: "A" } // optional metadata filter
});
```

## Methods

### createIndex()

Creates a new vector collection. The index name must start with a letter or underscore and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. The dimension must be a positive integer.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the index to create",
    },
    {

        "Distance metric for similarity search. Note: Currently only cosine similarity is supported by LibSQL.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### upsert()

Adds or updates vectors and their metadata in the index. Uses a transaction to ensure all vectors are inserted atomically - if any insert fails, the entire operation is rolled back.

      name: "queryVector",
      type: "number[]",
      description: "Query vector to find similar vectors for",
    },
    {
      name: "topK",
      type: "number",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "10",

      defaultValue: "false",
      description: "Whether to include vector data in results",
    },
    {
      name: "minScore",
      type: "number",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "0",

    queryVector: queryVector,
  });
} catch (error) {
  // Handle specific error cases
  if (error.message.includes("Invalid index name format")) {
    console.error(

# Metadata Filters
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/rag/metadata-filters

Mastra provides a unified metadata filtering syntax across all vector stores, based on MongoDB/Sift query syntax. Each vector store translates these filters into their native format.

## Basic Example

```typescript
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";

const store = new PgVector({ connectionString });

const results = await store.query({
  indexName: "my_index",
  queryVector: queryVector,
  topK: 10,
  filter: {
    category: "electronics", // Simple equality
    price: { $gt: 100 }, // Numeric comparison
    tags: { $in: ["sale", "new"] }, // Array membership
  },
});
```

## Common Rules and Restrictions

1. Field names cannot:

   - Contain dots (.) unless referring to nested fields
   - Start with $ or contain null characters
   - Be empty strings

2. Values must be:

   - Valid JSON types (string, number, boolean, object, array)
   - Not undefined
   - Properly typed for the operator (e.g., numbers for numeric comparisons)

3. Logical operators:

   - Must contain valid conditions
   - Cannot be empty
   - Must be properly nested
   - Can only be used at top level or nested within other logical operators
   - Cannot be used at field level or nested inside a field
   - Cannot be used inside an operator
   - Valid: `{ "$and": [{ "field": { "$gt": 100 } }] }`
   - Valid: `{ "$or": [{ "$and": [{ "field": { "$gt": 100 } }] }] }`
   - Invalid: `{ "field": { "$and": [{ "$gt": 100 }] } }`
   - Invalid: `{ "field": { "$gt": { "$and": [{...}] } } }`

4. $not operator:

   - Must be an object
   - Cannot be empty
   - Can be used at field level or top level
   - Valid: `{ "$not": { "field": "value" } }`
   - Valid: `{ "field": { "$not": { "$eq": "value" } } }`

5. Operator nesting:
   - Logical operators must contain field conditions, not direct operators
   - Valid: `{ "$and": [{ "field": { "$gt": 100 } }] }`
   - Invalid: `{ "$and": [{ "$gt": 100 }] }`

## Store-Specific Notes

### Astra

- Nested field queries are supported using dot notation
- Array fields must be explicitly defined as arrays in the metadata
- Metadata values are case-sensitive

### ChromaDB

- Where filters only return results where the filtered field exists in metadata
- Empty metadata fields are not included in filter results
- Metadata fields must be present for negative matches (e.g., $ne won't match documents missing the field)

### Cloudflare Vectorize

- Requires explicit metadata indexing before filtering can be used
- Use `createMetadataIndex()` to index fields you want to filter on
- Up to 10 metadata indexes per Vectorize index
- String values are indexed up to first 64 bytes (truncated on UTF-8 boundaries)
- Number values use float64 precision
- Filter JSON must be under 2048 bytes
- Field names cannot contain dots (.) or start with $
- Field names limited to 512 characters
- Vectors must be re-upserted after creating new metadata indexes to be included in filtered results
- Range queries may have reduced accuracy with very large datasets (~10M+ vectors)

### LibSQL

- Supports nested object queries with dot notation
- Array fields are validated to ensure they contain valid JSON arrays
- Numeric comparisons maintain proper type handling
- Empty arrays in conditions are handled gracefully
- Metadata is stored in a JSONB column for efficient querying

### PgVector

- Full support for PostgreSQL's native JSON querying capabilities
- Efficient handling of array operations using native array functions
- Proper type handling for numbers, strings, and booleans
- Nested field queries use PostgreSQL's JSON path syntax internally
- Metadata is stored in a JSONB column for efficient indexing

### Pinecone

- Metadata field names are limited to 512 characters
- Numeric values must be within the range of ±1e38
- Arrays in metadata are limited to 64KB total size
- Nested objects are flattened with dot notation
- Metadata updates replace the entire metadata object

### Qdrant

- Supports advanced filtering with nested conditions
- Payload (metadata) fields must be explicitly indexed for filtering
- Efficient handling of geo-spatial queries
- Special handling for null and empty values
- Vector-specific filtering capabilities
- Datetime values must be in RFC 3339 format

### Upstash

- 512-character limit for metadata field keys
- Query size is limited (avoid large IN clauses)
- No support for null/undefined values in filters
- Translates to SQL-like syntax internally
- Case-sensitive string comparisons
- Metadata updates are atomic

### MongoDB

- Full support for MongoDB/Sift query syntax for metadata filters
- Supports all standard comparison, array, logical, and element operators
- Supports nested fields and arrays in metadata
- Filtering can be applied to both `metadata` and the original document content using the `filter` and `documentFilter` options, respectively
- `filter` applies to the metadata object; `documentFilter` applies to the original document fields
- No artificial limits on filter size or complexity (subject to MongoDB query limits)
- Indexing metadata fields is recommended for optimal performance

### Couchbase
- Currently does not have support for metadata filters. Filtering must be done client-side after retrieving results or by using the Couchbase SDK's Search capabilities directly for more complex queries.

## Response Types

Query results are returned in this format:

```typescript copy
interface QueryResult {
  id: string;
  score: number;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  vector?: number[]; // Only included if includeVector is true
}
```

## Error Handling

The store throws typed errors that can be caught:

```typescript copy
try {
  await store.query({
    indexName: "my_collection",
    queryVector: queryVector,
  });
} catch (error) {
  // Handle specific error cases
  if (error.message.includes("Invalid collection name")) {
    console.error(
      "Collection name must start with a letter or underscore and contain only valid characters.",
    );
  } else if (error.message.includes("Collection not found")) {
    console.error("The specified collection does not exist");
  } else {
    console.error("Vector store error:", error.message);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Index metadata fields used in filters for optimal query performance.
- Use consistent field naming in metadata to avoid unexpected query results.
- Regularly monitor index and collection statistics to ensure efficient search.

#### Memory Requirements

HNSW indexes require significant shared memory during construction. For 100K vectors:

- Small dimensions (64d): ~60MB with default settings
- Medium dimensions (256d): ~180MB with default settings
- Large dimensions (384d+): ~250MB+ with default settings

Higher M values or efConstruction values will increase memory requirements significantly. Adjust your system's shared memory limits if needed.

await pgVector.updateVector({
  indexName: "my_vectors",
  id: "vector123",
  update: {
    metadata: { label: "updated" },
  },
});

// Update both vector and metadata
await pgVector.updateVector({
  indexName: "my_vectors",
  id: "vector123",
  update: {
    vector: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
    metadata: { label: "updated" },
  },
});
```

### deleteVector()

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the index containing the vector",
    },
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "ID of the vector to delete",
    },
  ]}
/>

Deletes a single vector by ID from the specified index.

```typescript copy
await pgVector.deleteVector({ indexName: "my_vectors", id: "vector123" });
```

### disconnect()

Closes the database connection pool. Should be called when done using the store.

### buildIndex()

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "indexName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the index to define",
    },
    {
      name: "metric",
      type: "'cosine' | 'euclidean' | 'dotproduct'",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "cosine",
      description: "Distance metric for similarity search",
    },
    {
      name: "indexConfig",
      type: "IndexConfig",
      description: "Configuration for the index type and parameters",
    },
  ]}
/>

Builds or rebuilds an index with specified metric and configuration. Will drop any existing index before creating the new one.

```typescript copy
// Define HNSW index
await pgVector.buildIndex("my_vectors", "cosine", {
  type: "hnsw",
  hnsw: {
    m: 8,
    efConstruction: 32,
  },
});

// Define IVF index
await pgVector.buildIndex("my_vectors", "cosine", {
  type: "ivfflat",
  ivf: {
    lists: 100,
  },
});

// Define flat index
await pgVector.buildIndex("my_vectors", "cosine", {
  type: "flat",
});
```

## Response Types

Query results are returned in this format:

```typescript copy
interface QueryResult {
  id: string;
  score: number;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  vector?: number[]; // Only included if includeVector is true
}
```

## Error Handling

The store throws typed errors that can be caught:

```typescript copy
try {
  await store.query({
    indexName: "index_name",
    queryVector: queryVector,
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof VectorStoreError) {
    console.log(error.code); // 'connection_failed' | 'invalid_dimension' | etc
    console.log(error.details); // Additional error context
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Regularly evaluate your index configuration to ensure optimal performance.
- Adjust parameters like `lists` and `m` based on dataset size and query requirements.
- Rebuild indexes periodically to maintain efficiency, especially after significant data changes.

## Direct Pool Access

The `PgVector` class exposes its underlying PostgreSQL connection pool as a public field:

```typescript
pgVector.pool // instance of pg.Pool
```

This enables advanced usage such as running direct SQL queries, managing transactions, or monitoring pool state. When using the pool directly:
- You are responsible for releasing clients (`client.release()`) after use.
- The pool remains accessible after calling `disconnect()`, but new queries will fail.
- Direct access bypasses any validation or transaction logic provided by PgVector methods.

This design supports advanced use cases but requires careful resource management by the user.

description: Documentation for the rerank function in Mastra, which provides advanced reranking capabilities for vector search results.
---

# rerank()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/rag/rerank

The `rerank()` function provides advanced reranking capabilities for vector search results by combining semantic relevance, vector similarity, and position-based scoring.

```typescript
function rerank(
  results: QueryResult[],
  query: string,
  modelConfig: ModelConfig,
  options?: RerankerFunctionOptions,
): Promise<RerankResult[]>;
```

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { rerank } from "@mastra/rag";

const model = openai("gpt-4o-mini");

const rerankedResults = await rerank(
  vectorSearchResults,
  "How do I deploy to production?",
  model,
  {
    weights: {
      semantic: 0.5,
      vector: 0.3,
      position: 0.2,
    },
    topK: 3,
  },
);
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "results",
      type: "QueryResult[]",
      description: "The vector search results to rerank",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "query",
      type: "string",
      description: "The search query text used to evaluate relevance",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "model",
      type: "MastraLanguageModel",
      description: "The language Model to use for reranking",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "options",
      type: "RerankerFunctionOptions",
      description: "Options for the reranking model",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

The rerank function accepts any LanguageModel from the Vercel AI SDK. When using the Cohere model `rerank-v3.5`, it will automatically use Cohere's reranking capabilities.

> **Note:** For semantic scoring to work properly during re-ranking, each result must include the text content in its `metadata.text` field.

import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { rerankWithScorer as rerank, CohereRelevanceScorer } from "@mastra/rag";

const scorer = new CohereRelevanceScorer('rerank-v3.5');

const rerankedResults = await rerank({
  results: vectorSearchResults,
  query: "How do I deploy to production?",
  scorer,
  options: {
    weights: {
      semantic: 0.5,
      vector: 0.3,
      position: 0.2,
    },
    topK: 3,
  },
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "results",
      type: "QueryResult[]",
      description: "The vector search results to rerank",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "query",
      type: "string",
      description: "The search query text used to evaluate relevance",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "scorer",
      type: "RelevanceScoreProvider",

binding = "D1Database"
database_name = "db-name"
database_id = "db-id"
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "binding",
      type: "D1Database",
      description: "Cloudflare D1 Workers binding (for Workers runtime)",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "accountId",
      type: "string",
      description: "Cloudflare Account ID (for REST API)",

      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Additional Notes

### Schema Management

The storage implementation handles schema creation and updates automatically. It creates the following tables:

- `threads`: Stores conversation threads
- `messages`: Stores individual messages
- `metadata`: Stores additional metadata for threads and messages

### Transactions & Consistency

Cloudflare D1 provides transactional guarantees for single-row operations. This means that multiple operations can be executed as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work.

### Table Creation & Migrations

Tables are created automatically when storage is initialized (and can be isolated per environment using the `tablePrefix` option), but advanced schema changes—such as adding columns, changing data types, or modifying indexes—require manual migration and careful planning to avoid data loss.

#### Additional Notes

### Schema Management

The storage implementation handles schema creation and updates automatically. It creates the following tables:

- `threads`: Stores conversation threads
- `messages`: Stores individual messages
- `metadata`: Stores additional metadata for threads and messages

### Consistency & Propagation

Cloudflare KV is an eventually consistent store, meaning that data may not be immediately available across all regions after a write.

### Key Structure & Namespacing

Keys in Cloudflare KV are structured as a combination of a configurable prefix and a table-specific format (e.g., `threads:threadId`).
For Workers deployments, `keyPrefix` is used to isolate data within a namespace; for REST API deployments, `namespacePrefix` is used to isolate entire namespaces between environments or applications.

# DynamoDB Storage
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/storage/dynamodb

The DynamoDB storage implementation provides a scalable and performant NoSQL database solution for Mastra, leveraging a single-table design pattern with [ElectroDB](https://electrodb.dev/).

## Features

- Efficient single-table design for all Mastra storage needs
- Based on ElectroDB for type-safe DynamoDB access
- Support for AWS credentials, regions, and endpoints
- Compatible with AWS DynamoDB Local for development
- Stores Thread, Message, Trace, Eval, and Workflow data
- Optimized for serverless environments

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/dynamodb@latest
# or
pnpm add @mastra/dynamodb@latest
# or
yarn add @mastra/dynamodb@latest
```

## Prerequisites

Before using this package, you **must** create a DynamoDB table with a specific structure, including primary keys and Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs). This adapter expects the DynamoDB table and its GSIs to be provisioned externally.

Detailed instructions for setting up the table using AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK are available in [TABLE_SETUP.md](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/blob/main/stores/dynamodb/TABLE_SETUP.md). Please ensure your table is configured according to those instructions before proceeding.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { DynamoDBStore } from "@mastra/dynamodb";

// Initialize the DynamoDB storage
const storage = new DynamoDBStore({
  name: "dynamodb", // A name for this storage instance
  config: {
    tableName: "mastra-single-table", // Name of your DynamoDB table
    region: "us-east-1", // Optional: AWS region, defaults to 'us-east-1'
    // endpoint: "http://localhost:8000", // Optional: For local DynamoDB
    // credentials: { accessKeyId: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", secretAccessKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" } // Optional
  },
});

// Example: Initialize Memory with DynamoDB storage
const memory = new Memory({
  storage,
  options: {
    lastMessages: 10,
  },
});
```

### Local Development with DynamoDB Local

For local development, you can use [DynamoDB Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html).

1.  **Run DynamoDB Local (e.g., using Docker):**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local
    ```

2.  **Configure `DynamoDBStore` to use the local endpoint:**

    ```typescript copy showLineNumbers
    import { DynamoDBStore } from "@mastra/dynamodb";

    const storage = new DynamoDBStore({
      name: "dynamodb-local",
      config: {
        tableName: "mastra-single-table", // Ensure this table is created in your local DynamoDB
        region: "localhost", // Can be any string for local, 'localhost' is common
        endpoint: "http://localhost:8000",
        // For DynamoDB Local, credentials are not typically required unless configured.
        // If you've configured local credentials:
        // credentials: { accessKeyId: "fakeMyKeyId", secretAccessKey: "fakeSecretAccessKey" }
      },
    });
    ```

    You will still need to create the table and GSIs in your local DynamoDB instance, for example, using the AWS CLI pointed to your local endpoint.

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      description: "A name for the storage instance.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "config.tableName",
      type: "string",
      description: "The name of your DynamoDB table.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "config.region",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "AWS region. Defaults to 'us-east-1'. For local development, can be set to 'localhost' or similar.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "config.endpoint",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "Custom endpoint for DynamoDB (e.g., 'http://localhost:8000' for local development).",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "config.credentials",
      type: "object",
      description:
        "AWS credentials object with `accessKeyId` and `secretAccessKey`. If not provided, the AWS SDK will attempt to source credentials from environment variables, IAM roles (e.g., for EC2/Lambda), or the shared AWS credentials file.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## AWS IAM Permissions

The IAM role or user executing the code needs appropriate permissions to interact with the specified DynamoDB table and its indexes. Below is a sample policy. Replace `${YOUR_TABLE_NAME}` with your actual table name and `${YOUR_AWS_REGION}` and `${YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}` with appropriate values.

```json copy
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:PutItem",
        "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
        "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
        "dynamodb:Query",
        "dynamodb:Scan",
        "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
        "dynamodb:BatchWriteItem"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:${YOUR_AWS_REGION}:${YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:table/${YOUR_TABLE_NAME}",
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:${YOUR_AWS_REGION}:${YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:table/${YOUR_TABLE_NAME}/index/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Considerations

Before diving into the architectural details, keep these key points in mind when working with the DynamoDB storage adapter:

- **External Table Provisioning:** This adapter _requires_ you to create and configure the DynamoDB table and its Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) yourself, prior to using the adapter. Follow the guide in [TABLE_SETUP.md](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/blob/main/stores/dynamodb/TABLE_SETUP.md).
- **Single-Table Design:** All Mastra data (threads, messages, etc.) is stored in one DynamoDB table. This is a deliberate design choice optimized for DynamoDB, differing from relational database approaches.
- **Understanding GSIs:** Familiarity with how the GSIs are structured (as per `TABLE_SETUP.md`) is important for understanding data retrieval and potential query patterns.
- **ElectroDB:** The adapter uses ElectroDB to manage interactions with DynamoDB, providing a layer of abstraction and type safety over raw DynamoDB operations.

## Architectural Approach

This storage adapter utilizes a **single-table design pattern** leveraging [ElectroDB](https://electrodb.dev/), a common and recommended approach for DynamoDB. This differs architecturally from relational database adapters (like `@mastra/pg` or `@mastra/libsql`) that typically use multiple tables, each dedicated to a specific entity (threads, messages, etc.).

Key aspects of this approach:

- **DynamoDB Native:** The single-table design is optimized for DynamoDB's key-value and query capabilities, often leading to better performance and scalability compared to mimicking relational models.
- **External Table Management:** Unlike some adapters that might offer helper functions to create tables via code, this adapter **expects the DynamoDB table and its associated Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs) to be provisioned externally** before use. Please refer to [TABLE_SETUP.md](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/blob/main/stores/dynamodb/TABLE_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions using tools like AWS CloudFormation or CDK. The adapter focuses solely on interacting with the pre-existing table structure.
- **Consistency via Interface:** While the underlying storage model differs, this adapter adheres to the same `MastraStorage` interface as other adapters, ensuring it can be used interchangeably within the Mastra `Memory` component.

### Mastra Data in the Single Table

Within the single DynamoDB table, different Mastra data entities (such as Threads, Messages, Traces, Evals, and Workflows) are managed and distinguished using ElectroDB. ElectroDB defines specific models for each entity type, which include unique key structures and attributes. This allows the adapter to store and retrieve diverse data types efficiently within the same table.

For example, a `Thread` item might have a primary key like `THREAD#<threadId>`, while a `Message` item belonging to that thread might use `THREAD#<threadId>` as a partition key and `MESSAGE#<messageId>` as a sort key. The Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs), detailed in `TABLE_SETUP.md`, are strategically designed to support common access patterns across these different entities, such as fetching all messages for a thread or querying traces associated with a particular workflow.

### Advantages of Single-Table Design

This implementation uses a single-table design pattern with ElectroDB, which offers several advantages within the context of DynamoDB:

1.  **Lower cost (potentially):** Fewer tables can simplify Read/Write Capacity Unit (RCU/WCU) provisioning and management, especially with on-demand capacity.
2.  **Better performance:** Related data can be co-located or accessed efficiently through GSIs, enabling fast lookups for common access patterns.
3.  **Simplified administration:** Fewer distinct tables to monitor, back up, and manage.
4.  **Reduced complexity in access patterns:** ElectroDB helps manage the complexity of item types and access patterns on a single table.
5.  **Transaction support:** DynamoDB transactions can be used across different "entity" types stored within the same table if needed.

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/pg@latest
```

## Usage

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { PostgresStore } from "@mastra/pg";

const storage = new PostgresStore({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "connectionString",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname)",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "schemaName",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The name of the schema you want the storage to use. Will use the default schema if not provided.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Constructor Examples

You can instantiate `PostgresStore` in the following ways:

```ts
import { PostgresStore } from "@mastra/pg";

// Using a connection string only
const store1 = new PostgresStore({
  connectionString: "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb",
});

// Using a connection string with a custom schema name
const store2 = new PostgresStore({
  connectionString: "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb",
  schemaName: "custom_schema", // optional
});

// Using individual connection parameters
const store4 = new PostgresStore({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5432,
  database: "mydb",
  user: "user",
  password: "password",
});

// Individual parameters with schemaName
const store5 = new PostgresStore({
  host: "localhost",
  port: 5432,
  database: "mydb",
  user: "user",
  password: "password",
  schemaName: "custom_schema", // optional
});
```

## Additional Notes

### Schema Management

The storage implementation handles schema creation and updates automatically. It creates the following tables:

- `threads`: Stores conversation threads
- `messages`: Stores individual messages
- `metadata`: Stores additional metadata for threads and messages

### Direct Database and Pool Access

`PostgresStore` exposes both the underlying database object and the pg-promise instance as public fields:

```typescript
store.db  // pg-promise database instance
store.pgp // pg-promise main instance
```

This enables direct queries and custom transaction management. When using these fields:
- You are responsible for proper connection and transaction handling.
- Closing the store (`store.close()`) will destroy the associated connection pool.
- Direct access bypasses any additional logic or validation provided by PostgresStore methods.

This approach is intended for advanced scenarios where low-level access is required.

# MastraMCPClient (Deprecated)
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/tools/client

The `MastraMCPClient` class provides a client implementation for interacting with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It handles connection management, resource discovery, and tool execution through the MCP protocol.

## Deprecation notice

`MastraMCPClient` is being deprecated in favour of [`MCPClient`](./mcp-client). Rather than having two different interfaces for managing a single MCP server vs multiple MCP servers, we opted to recommend using the interface to manage multiple even when using a single MCP server.

## Constructor

Creates a new instance of the MastraMCPClient.

```typescript
constructor({
    name,
    version = '1.0.0',
    server,
    capabilities = {},
    timeout = 60000,
}: {
    name: string;
    server: MastraMCPServerDefinition;
    capabilities?: ClientCapabilities;
    version?: string;
    timeout?: number;
})
```

### Parameters

<br />
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      description: "The name identifier for this client instance.",
    },
    {
      name: "version",
      type: "string",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "1.0.0",
      description: "The version of the client.",
    },
    {
      name: "server",
      type: "MastraMCPServerDefinition",
      description:
        "Configuration parameters for either a stdio server connection or an SSE server connection. Can include log handler and server logs configuration.",
    },
    {
      name: "capabilities",
      type: "ClientCapabilities",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "{}",
      description: "Optional capabilities configuration for the client.",
    },
    {

      defaultValue: 60000,
      description:
        "The timeout duration, in milliseconds, for client tool calls.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### MastraMCPServerDefinition

MCP servers can be configured using this definition. The client automatically detects the transport type based on the provided parameters:

- If `command` is provided, it uses the Stdio transport.
- If `url` is provided, it first attempts to use the Streamable HTTP transport and falls back to the legacy SSE transport if the initial connection fails.

    },
    {
      name: "args",
      type: "string[]",
      isOptional: true,

## Examples

### Using with Mastra Agent

#### Example with Stdio Server

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { MastraMCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Initialize the MCP client using mcp/fetch as an example https://hub.docker.com/r/mcp/fetch
// Visit https://github.com/docker/mcp-servers for other reference docker mcp servers
const fetchClient = new MastraMCPClient({
  name: "fetch",
  server: {
    command: "docker",
    args: ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp/fetch"],
    logger: (logMessage) => {
      console.log(`[${logMessage.level}] ${logMessage.message}`);
    },
  },
});

// Create a Mastra Agent
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Fetch agent",
  instructions:
    "You are able to fetch data from URLs on demand and discuss the response data with the user.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

try {
  // Connect to the MCP server
  await fetchClient.connect();

  // Gracefully handle process exits so the docker subprocess is cleaned up
  process.on("exit", () => {
    fetchClient.disconnect();
  });

  // Get available tools
  const tools = await fetchClient.tools();

  // Use the agent with the MCP tools
  const response = await agent.generate(
    "Tell me about mastra.ai/docs. Tell me generally what this page is and the content it includes.",
    {
      toolsets: {
        fetch: tools,
      },
    },
  );

  console.log("\n\n" + response.text);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error);
} finally {
  // Always disconnect when done
  await fetchClient.disconnect();
}
```

### Example with SSE Server

```typescript
// Initialize the MCP client using an SSE server
const sseClient = new MastraMCPClient({
  name: "sse-client",
  server: {
    url: new URL("https://your-mcp-server.com/sse"),
    // Optional fetch request configuration - Note: requestInit alone isn't enough for SSE
    requestInit: {
      headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer your-token",
      },
    },
    // Required for SSE connections with custom headers
    eventSourceInit: {
      fetch(input: Request | URL | string, init?: RequestInit) {
        const headers = new Headers(init?.headers || {});
        headers.set("Authorization", "Bearer your-token");
        return fetch(input, {
          ...init,
          headers,
        });
      },
    },
    // Optional additional logging configuration
    logger: (logMessage) => {
      console.log(
        `[${logMessage.level}] ${logMessage.serverName}: ${logMessage.message}`,
      );
    },
    // Disable server logs
    enableServerLogs: false,
  },
});

// The rest of the usage is identical to the stdio example
```

### Important Note About SSE Authentication

When using SSE connections with authentication or custom headers, you need to configure both `requestInit` and `eventSourceInit`. This is because SSE connections use the browser's EventSource API, which doesn't support custom headers directly.

The `eventSourceInit` configuration allows you to customize the underlying fetch request used for the SSE connection, ensuring your authentication headers are properly included.
Without `eventSourceInit`, authentication headers specified in `requestInit` won't be included in the connection request, leading to 401 Unauthorized errors.

# createTool()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/tools/create-tool

The `createTool()` function is used to define custom tools that your Mastra agents can execute. Tools extend an agent's capabilities by allowing it to interact with external systems, perform calculations, or access specific data.

## Basic Usage

Here is a basic example of creating a tool that fetches weather information:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/weatherInfo.ts" copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const weatherInfo = createTool({
  id: "Get Weather Information",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  execute: async ({ context: { city } }) => {
    // Tool logic here (e.g., API call)
    console.log("Using tool to fetch weather information for", city);
    return { temperature: 20, conditions: "Sunny" }; // Example return
  },
});
```

## Parameters

The `createTool()` function accepts an object with the following parameters:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "A unique identifier for the tool.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "description",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "A description of what the tool does. This is used by the agent to decide when to use the tool.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "inputSchema",
      type: "Zod schema",
      description:
        "A Zod schema defining the expected input parameters for the tool's `execute` function.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "outputSchema",
      type: "Zod schema",
      description:
        "A Zod schema defining the expected output structure of the tool's `execute` function.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "execute",
      type: "function",
      description:
        "The function that contains the tool's logic. It receives an object with `context` (the parsed input based on `inputSchema`), `runtimeContext`, and an object containing `abortSignal`.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

The `createTool()` function returns a `Tool` object.

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "Tool",
      type: "object",
      description:
        "An object representing the defined tool, ready to be added to an agent.",
    },
  ]}
/>

# createGraphRAGTool()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/tools/graph-rag-tool

The `createGraphRAGTool()` creates a tool that enhances RAG by building a graph of semantic relationships between documents. It uses the `GraphRAG` system under the hood to provide graph-based retrieval, finding relevant content through both direct similarity and connected relationships.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { createGraphRAGTool } from "@mastra/rag";

const graphTool = createGraphRAGTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  graphOptions: {
    dimension: 1536,
    threshold: 0.7,
    randomWalkSteps: 100,
    restartProb: 0.15,
  },
});
```

## Parameters

<Callout>
  **Parameter Requirements:** Most fields can be set at creation as defaults.
  Some fields can be overridden at runtime via the runtime context or input. If
  a required field is missing from both creation and runtime, an error will be
  thrown. Note that `model`, `id`, and `description` can only be set at creation
  time.

  ]}
/>

## Returns

The tool returns an object with:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "relevantContext",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "Combined text from the most relevant document chunks, retrieved using graph-based ranking",
    },
    {
      name: "sources",
      type: "QueryResult[]",
      description:
        "Array of full retrieval result objects. Each object contains all information needed to reference the original document, chunk, and similarity score.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### QueryResult object structure

```typescript
{
  id: string;         // Unique chunk/document identifier
  metadata: any;      // All metadata fields (document ID, etc.)
  vector: number[];   // Embedding vector (if available)
  score: number;      // Similarity score for this retrieval
  document: string;   // Full chunk/document text (if available)
}
```

## Default Tool Description

The default description focuses on:

- Analyzing relationships between documents
- Finding patterns and connections
- Answering complex queries

## Advanced Example

```typescript
const graphTool = createGraphRAGTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  graphOptions: {
    dimension: 1536,
    threshold: 0.8, // Higher similarity threshold
    randomWalkSteps: 200, // More exploration steps
    restartProb: 0.2, // Higher restart probability
  },
});
```

## Example with Custom Description

```typescript
const graphTool = createGraphRAGTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  description:
    "Analyze document relationships to find complex patterns and connections in our company's historical data",
});
```

This example shows how to customize the tool description for a specific use case while maintaining its core purpose of relationship analysis.

## Example: Using Runtime Context

```typescript
const graphTool = createGraphRAGTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});
```

When using runtime context, provide required parameters at execution time via the runtime context:

```typescript
const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext<{
  vectorStoreName: string;
  indexName: string;
  topK: number;
  filter: any;
}>();
runtimeContext.set("vectorStoreName", "my-store");
runtimeContext.set("indexName", "my-index");
runtimeContext.set("topK", 5);
runtimeContext.set("filter", { category: "docs" });
runtimeContext.set("randomWalkSteps", 100);
runtimeContext.set("restartProb", 0.15);

const response = await agent.generate(
  "Find documentation from the knowledge base.",
  {
    runtimeContext,
  },
);
```

For more information on runtime context, please see:

- [Runtime Variables](../../docs/agents/runtime-variables)
- [Dynamic Context](../../docs/tools-mcp/dynamic-context)

[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/tools/mcp-client

The `MCPClient` class provides a way to manage multiple MCP server connections and their tools in a Mastra application. It handles connection lifecycle, tool namespacing, and provides access to tools across all configured servers.

This class replaces the deprecated [`MastraMCPClient`](/reference/tools/client).

## Constructor

Creates a new instance of the MCPClient class.

```typescript
constructor({
  id?: string;
  servers: Record<string, MastraMCPServerDefinition>;
  timeout?: number;
}: MCPClientOptions)
```

### MCPClientOptions

<br />
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      isOptional: true,
      description:
        "Optional unique identifier for the configuration instance. Use this to prevent memory leaks when creating multiple instances with identical configurations.",
    },
    {
      name: "servers",
      type: "Record<string, MastraMCPServerDefinition>",
      description:
        "A map of server configurations, where each key is a unique server identifier and the value is the server configuration.",
    },
    {
      name: "timeout",
      type: "number",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "60000",
      description:
        "Global timeout value in milliseconds for all servers unless overridden in individual server configs.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### MastraMCPServerDefinition

Each server in the `servers` map is configured using the `MastraMCPServerDefinition` type. The transport type is detected based on the provided parameters:

- If `command` is provided, it uses the Stdio transport.
- If `url` is provided, it first attempts to use the Streamable HTTP transport and falls back to the legacy SSE transport if the initial connection fails.

## Methods

### getTools()

Retrieves all tools from all configured servers, with tool names namespaced by their server name (in the format `serverName_toolName`) to prevent conflicts.
Intended to be passed onto an Agent definition.

```ts
new Agent({ tools: await mcp.getTools() });
```

### getToolsets()

Returns an object mapping namespaced tool names (in the format `serverName.toolName`) to their tool implementations.
Intended to be passed dynamically into the generate or stream method.

```typescript
const res = await agent.stream(prompt, {
  toolsets: await mcp.getToolsets(),
});
```

### disconnect()

Disconnects from all MCP servers and cleans up resources.

```typescript
async disconnect(): Promise<void>
```

### `resources` Property

The `MCPClient` instance has a `resources` property that provides access to resource-related operations.

```typescript
const mcpClient = new MCPClient({
  /* ...servers configuration... */
});

// Access resource methods via mcpClient.resources
const allResourcesByServer = await mcpClient.resources.list();
const templatesByServer = await mcpClient.resources.templates();
// ... and so on for other resource methods.
```

#### `resources.list()`

Retrieves all available resources from all connected MCP servers, grouped by server name.

```typescript
async list(): Promise<Record<string, Resource[]>>
```

Example:

```typescript
const resourcesByServer = await mcpClient.resources.list();
for (const serverName in resourcesByServer) {
  console.log(`Resources from ${serverName}:`, resourcesByServer[serverName]);
}
```

#### `resources.templates()`

Retrieves all available resource templates from all connected MCP servers, grouped by server name.

```typescript
async templates(): Promise<Record<string, ResourceTemplate[]>>
```

Example:

```typescript
const templatesByServer = await mcpClient.resources.templates();
for (const serverName in templatesByServer) {
  console.log(`Templates from ${serverName}:`, templatesByServer[serverName]);
}
```

#### `resources.read(serverName: string, uri: string)`

Reads the content of a specific resource from a named server.

```typescript
async read(serverName: string, uri: string): Promise<ReadResourceResult>
```

- `serverName`: The identifier of the server (key used in the `servers` constructor option).
- `uri`: The URI of the resource to read.

Example:

```typescript
const content = await mcpClient.resources.read(
  "myWeatherServer",
  "weather://current",
);
console.log("Current weather:", content.contents[0].text);
```

#### `resources.subscribe(serverName: string, uri: string)`

Subscribes to updates for a specific resource on a named server.

```typescript
async subscribe(serverName: string, uri: string): Promise<object>
```

Example:

```typescript
await mcpClient.resources.subscribe("myWeatherServer", "weather://current");
```

#### `resources.unsubscribe(serverName: string, uri: string)`

Unsubscribes from updates for a specific resource on a named server.

```typescript
async unsubscribe(serverName: string, uri: string): Promise<object>
```

Example:

```typescript
await mcpClient.resources.unsubscribe("myWeatherServer", "weather://current");
```

#### `resources.onUpdated(serverName: string, handler: (params: { uri: string }) => void)`

Sets a notification handler that will be called when a subscribed resource on a specific server is updated.

```typescript
async onUpdated(serverName: string, handler: (params: { uri: string }) => void): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
mcpClient.resources.onUpdated("myWeatherServer", (params) => {
  console.log(`Resource updated on myWeatherServer: ${params.uri}`);
  // You might want to re-fetch the resource content here
  // await mcpClient.resources.read("myWeatherServer", params.uri);
});
```

#### `resources.onListChanged(serverName: string, handler: () => void)`

Sets a notification handler that will be called when the overall list of available resources changes on a specific server.

```typescript
async onListChanged(serverName: string, handler: () => void): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
mcpClient.resources.onListChanged("myWeatherServer", () => {
  console.log("Resource list changed on myWeatherServer.");
  // You should re-fetch the list of resources
  // await mcpClient.resources.list();
});
```

### `prompts` Property

The `MCPClient` instance has a `prompts` property that provides access to prompt-related operations.

```typescript
const mcpClient = new MCPClient({
  /* ...servers configuration... */
});

// Access prompt methods via mcpClient.prompts
const allPromptsByServer = await mcpClient.prompts.list();
const { prompt, messages } = await mcpClient.prompts.get({
  serverName: "myWeatherServer",
  name: "current",
});
```

### `elicitation` Property

The `MCPClient` instance has an `elicitation` property that provides access to elicitation-related operations. Elicitation allows MCP servers to request structured information from users.

```typescript
const mcpClient = new MCPClient({
  /* ...servers configuration... */
});

// Set up elicitation handler
mcpClient.elicitation.onRequest('serverName', async (request) => {
  // Handle elicitation request from server
  console.log('Server requests:', request.message);
  console.log('Schema:', request.requestedSchema);
  
  // Return user response
  return {
    action: 'accept',
    content: { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' }
  };
});
```

#### `elicitation.onRequest(serverName: string, handler: ElicitationHandler)`

Sets up a handler function that will be called when any connected MCP server sends an elicitation request. The handler receives the request and must return a response.

**ElicitationHandler Function:**

The handler function receives a request object with:
- `message`: A human-readable message describing what information is needed
- `requestedSchema`: A JSON schema defining the structure of the expected response

The handler must return an `ElicitResult` with:
- `action`: One of `'accept'`, `'reject'`, or `'cancel'`
- `content`: The user's data (only when action is `'accept'`)

**Example:**

```typescript
mcpClient.elicitation.onRequest('serverName', async (request) => {
  console.log(`Server requests: ${request.message}`);
  
  // Example: Simple user input collection
  if (request.requestedSchema.properties.name) {
    // Simulate user accepting and providing data
    return {
      action: 'accept',
      content: {
        name: 'Alice Smith',
        email: 'alice@example.com'
      }
    };
  }
  
  // Simulate user rejecting the request
  return { action: 'reject' };
});
```

**Complete Interactive Example:**

```typescript
import { MCPClient } from '@mastra/mcp';
import { createInterface } from 'readline';

const readline = createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

function askQuestion(question: string): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    readline.question(question, answer => resolve(answer.trim()));
  });
}

const mcpClient = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    interactiveServer: {
      url: new URL('http://localhost:3000/mcp'),
    },
  },
});

// Set up interactive elicitation handler
await mcpClient.elicitation.onRequest('interactiveServer', async (request) => {
  console.log(`\n📋 Server Request: ${request.message}`);
  console.log('Required information:');
  
  const schema = request.requestedSchema;
  const properties = schema.properties || {};
  const required = schema.required || [];
  const content: Record<string, any> = {};
  
  // Collect input for each field
  for (const [fieldName, fieldSchema] of Object.entries(properties)) {
    const field = fieldSchema as any;
    const isRequired = required.includes(fieldName);
    
    let prompt = `${field.title || fieldName}`;
    if (field.description) prompt += ` (${field.description})`;
    if (isRequired) prompt += ' *required*';
    prompt += ': ';
    
    const answer = await askQuestion(prompt);
    
    // Handle cancellation
    if (answer.toLowerCase() === 'cancel') {
      return { action: 'cancel' };
    }
    
    // Validate required fields
    if (answer === '' && isRequired) {
      console.log(`❌ ${fieldName} is required`);
      return { action: 'reject' };
    }
    
    if (answer !== '') {
      content[fieldName] = answer;
    }
  }
  
  // Confirm submission
  console.log('\n📝 You provided:');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(content, null, 2));
  
  const confirm = await askQuestion('\nSubmit this information? (yes/no/cancel): ');
  
  if (confirm.toLowerCase() === 'yes' || confirm.toLowerCase() === 'y') {
    return { action: 'accept', content };
  } else if (confirm.toLowerCase() === 'cancel') {
    return { action: 'cancel' };
  } else {
    return { action: 'reject' };
  }
});
```

#### `prompts.list()`

Retrieves all available prompts from all connected MCP servers, grouped by server name.

```typescript
async list(): Promise<Record<string, Prompt[]>>
```

Example:

```typescript
const promptsByServer = await mcpClient.prompts.list();
for (const serverName in promptsByServer) {
  console.log(`Prompts from ${serverName}:`, promptsByServer[serverName]);
}
```

#### `prompts.get({ serverName, name, args?, version? })`

Retrieves a specific prompt and its messages from a server.

```typescript
async get({
  serverName,
  name,
  args?,
  version?,
}: {
  serverName: string;
  name: string;
  args?: Record<string, any>;
  version?: string;
}): Promise<{ prompt: Prompt; messages: PromptMessage[] }>
```

Example:

```typescript
const { prompt, messages } = await mcpClient.prompts.get({
  serverName: "myWeatherServer",
  name: "current",
  args: { location: "London" },
});
console.log(prompt);
console.log(messages);
```

#### `prompts.onListChanged(serverName: string, handler: () => void)`

Sets a notification handler that will be called when the list of available prompts changes on a specific server.

```typescript
async onListChanged(serverName: string, handler: () => void): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
mcpClient.prompts.onListChanged("myWeatherServer", () => {
  console.log("Prompt list changed on myWeatherServer.");
  // You should re-fetch the list of prompts
  // await mcpClient.prompts.list();
});
```

## Elicitation

Elicitation is a feature that allows MCP servers to request structured information from users. When a server needs additional data, it can send an elicitation request that the client handles by prompting the user. A common example is during a tool call.

### How Elicitation Works

1. **Server Request**: An MCP server tool calls `server.elicitation.sendRequest()` with a message and schema
2. **Client Handler**: Your elicitation handler function is called with the request
3. **User Interaction**: Your handler collects user input (via UI, CLI, etc.)
4. **Response**: Your handler returns the user's response (accept/reject/cancel)
5. **Tool Continuation**: The server tool receives the response and continues execution

### Setting Up Elicitation

You must set up an elicitation handler before tools that use elicitation are called:

```typescript
import { MCPClient } from '@mastra/mcp';

const mcpClient = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    interactiveServer: {
      url: new URL('http://localhost:3000/mcp'),
    },
  },
});

// Set up elicitation handler
mcpClient.elicitation.onRequest('interactiveServer', async (request) => {
  // Handle the server's request for user input
  console.log(`Server needs: ${request.message}`);
  
  // Your logic to collect user input
  const userData = await collectUserInput(request.requestedSchema);
  
  return {
    action: 'accept',
    content: userData
  };
});
```

### Response Types

Your elicitation handler must return one of three response types:

- **Accept**: User provided data and confirmed submission
  ```typescript
  return {
    action: 'accept',
    content: { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' }
  };
  ```

- **Reject**: User explicitly declined to provide the information
  ```typescript
  return { action: 'reject' };
  ```

- **Cancel**: User dismissed or cancelled the request
  ```typescript
  return { action: 'cancel' };
  ```

### Schema-Based Input Collection

The `requestedSchema` provides structure for the data the server needs:

```typescript
await mcpClient.elicitation.onRequest('interactiveServer', async (request) => {
  const { properties, required = [] } = request.requestedSchema;
  const content: Record<string, any> = {};
  
  for (const [fieldName, fieldSchema] of Object.entries(properties || {})) {
    const field = fieldSchema as any;
    const isRequired = required.includes(fieldName);
    
    // Collect input based on field type and requirements
    const value = await promptUser({
      name: fieldName,
      title: field.title,
      description: field.description,
      type: field.type,
      required: isRequired,
      format: field.format,
      enum: field.enum,
    });
    
    if (value !== null) {
      content[fieldName] = value;
    }
  }
  
  return { action: 'accept', content };
});
```

### Best Practices

- **Always handle elicitation**: Set up your handler before calling tools that might use elicitation
- **Validate input**: Check that required fields are provided
- **Respect user choice**: Handle reject and cancel responses gracefully
- **Clear UI**: Make it obvious what information is being requested and why
- **Security**: Never auto-accept requests for sensitive information

## Examples

### Static Tool Configuration

For tools where you have a single connection to the MCP server for you entire app, use `getTools()` and pass the tools to your agent:

```typescript
import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const mcp = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    stockPrice: {
      command: "npx",
      args: ["tsx", "stock-price.ts"],
      env: {
        API_KEY: "your-api-key",
      },
      log: (logMessage) => {
        console.log(`[${logMessage.level}] ${logMessage.message}`);
      },
    },
    weather: {
      url: new URL("http://localhost:8080/sse"),
    },
  },
  timeout: 30000, // Global 30s timeout
});

// Create an agent with access to all tools
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Multi-tool Agent",
  instructions: "You have access to multiple tool servers.",
  model: openai("gpt-4"),
  tools: await mcp.getTools(),
});

// Example of using resource methods
async function checkWeatherResource() {
  try {
    const weatherResources = await mcp.resources.list();
    if (weatherResources.weather && weatherResources.weather.length > 0) {
      const currentWeatherURI = weatherResources.weather[0].uri;
      const weatherData = await mcp.resources.read(
        "weather",
        currentWeatherURI,
      );
      console.log("Weather data:", weatherData.contents[0].text);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching weather resource:", error);
  }
}
checkWeatherResource();

// Example of using prompt methods
async function checkWeatherPrompt() {
  try {
    const weatherPrompts = await mcp.prompts.list();
    if (weatherPrompts.weather && weatherPrompts.weather.length > 0) {
      const currentWeatherPrompt = weatherPrompts.weather.find(
        (p) => p.name === "current"
      );
      if (currentWeatherPrompt) {
        console.log("Weather prompt:", currentWeatherPrompt);
      } else {
        console.log("Current weather prompt not found");
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching weather prompt:", error);
  }
}
checkWeatherPrompt();
```

### Dynamic toolsets

When you need a new MCP connection for each user, use `getToolsets()` and add the tools when calling stream or generate:

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { MCPClient } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create the agent first, without any tools
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Multi-tool Agent",
  instructions: "You help users check stocks and weather.",
  model: openai("gpt-4"),
});

// Later, configure MCP with user-specific settings
const mcp = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    stockPrice: {
      command: "npx",
      args: ["tsx", "stock-price.ts"],
      env: {
        API_KEY: "user-123-api-key",
      },
      timeout: 20000, // Server-specific timeout
    },
    weather: {
      url: new URL("http://localhost:8080/sse"),
      requestInit: {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer user-123-token`,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

// Pass all toolsets to stream() or generate()
const response = await agent.stream(
  "How is AAPL doing and what is the weather?",
  {
    toolsets: await mcp.getToolsets(),
  },
);
```

## Instance Management

The `MCPClient` class includes built-in memory leak prevention for managing multiple instances:

1. Creating multiple instances with identical configurations without an `id` will throw an error to prevent memory leaks
2. If you need multiple instances with identical configurations, provide a unique `id` for each instance
3. Call `await configuration.disconnect()` before recreating an instance with the same configuration
4. If you only need one instance, consider moving the configuration to a higher scope to avoid recreation

For example, if you try to create multiple instances with the same configuration without an `id`:

```typescript
// First instance - OK
const mcp1 = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    /* ... */
  },
});

// Second instance with same config - Will throw an error
const mcp2 = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    /* ... */
  },
});

// To fix, either:
// 1. Add unique IDs
const mcp3 = new MCPClient({
  id: "instance-1",
  servers: {
    /* ... */
  },
});

// 2. Or disconnect before recreating
await mcp1.disconnect();
const mcp4 = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

## Server Lifecycle

MCPClient handles server connections gracefully:

1. Automatic connection management for multiple servers
2. Graceful server shutdown to prevent error messages during development
3. Proper cleanup of resources when disconnecting

## Using SSE Request Headers

When using the legacy SSE MCP transport, you must configure both `requestInit` and `eventSourceInit` due to a bug in the MCP SDK:

```ts
const sseClient = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    exampleServer: {
      url: new URL("https://your-mcp-server.com/sse"),
      // Note: requestInit alone isn't enough for SSE
      requestInit: {
        headers: {
          Authorization: "Bearer your-token",
        },
      },
      // This is also required for SSE connections with custom headers
      eventSourceInit: {
        fetch(input: Request | URL | string, init?: RequestInit) {
          const headers = new Headers(init?.headers || {});
          headers.set("Authorization", "Bearer your-token");
          return fetch(input, {
            ...init,
            headers,
          });
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

# MCPServer
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/tools/mcp-server

The `MCPServer` class provides the functionality to expose your existing Mastra tools and Agents as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This allows any MCP client (like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Desktop) to connect to these capabilities and make them available to an agent.

Note that if you only need to use your tools or agents directly within your Mastra application, you don't necessarily need to create an MCP server. This API is specifically for exposing your Mastra tools and agents to _external_ MCP clients.

It supports both [stdio (subprocess) and SSE (HTTP) MCP transports](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports).

## Constructor

To create a new `MCPServer`, you need to provide some basic information about your server, the tools it will offer, and optionally, any agents you want to expose as tools.

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { z } from "zod";
import { dataProcessingWorkflow } from "../workflows/dataProcessingWorkflow";

const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: "MyExampleAgent",
  description: "A generalist to help with basic questions."
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "getWeather",
  description: "Gets the current weather for a location.",
  inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => `Weather in ${context.location} is sunny.`,
});

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: "My Custom Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: { weatherTool },
  agents: { myAgent }, // this agent will become tool "ask_myAgent"
  workflows: {
    dataProcessingWorkflow, // this workflow will become tool "run_dataProcessingWorkflow"
  }
});
```

### Configuration Properties

The constructor accepts an `MCPServerConfig` object with the following properties:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      isOptional: false,
      description:

## Exposing Agents as Tools

A powerful feature of `MCPServer` is its ability to automatically expose your Mastra Agents as callable tools. When you provide agents in the `agents` property of the configuration:

- **Tool Naming**: Each agent is converted into a tool named `ask_<agentKey>`, where `<agentKey>` is the key you used for that agent in the `agents` object. For instance, if you configure `agents: { myAgentKey: myAgentInstance }`, a tool named `ask_myAgentKey` will be created.

- **Tool Functionality**:

  - **Description**: The generated tool's description will be in the format: "Ask agent `<AgentName>` a question. Original agent instructions: `<agent description>`".
  - **Input**: The tool expects a single object argument with a `message` property (string): `{ message: "Your question for the agent" }`.
  - **Execution**: When this tool is called, it invokes the `generate()` method of the corresponding agent, passing the provided `query`.
  - **Output**: The direct result from the agent's `generate()` method is returned as the output of the tool.

- **Name Collisions**: If an explicit tool defined in the `tools` configuration has the same name as an agent-derived tool (e.g., you have a tool named `ask_myAgentKey` and also an agent with the key `myAgentKey`), the _explicitly defined tool will take precedence_. The agent will not be converted into a tool in this conflicting case, and a warning will be logged.

This makes it straightforward to allow MCP clients to interact with your agents using natural language queries, just like any other tool.

### Agent-to-Tool Conversion

When you provide agents in the `agents` configuration property, `MCPServer` will automatically create a corresponding tool for each agent. The tool will be named `ask_<agentIdentifier>`, where `<agentIdentifier>` is the key you used in the `agents` object.

The description for this generated tool will be: "Ask agent `<agent.name>` a question. Agent description: `<agent.description>`".

**Important**: For an agent to be converted into a tool, it **must** have a non-empty `description` string property set in its configuration when it was instantiated (e.g., `new Agent({ name: 'myAgent', description: 'This agent does X.', ... })`). If an agent is passed to `MCPServer` with a missing or empty `description`, an error will be thrown when the `MCPServer` is instantiated, and server setup will fail.

This allows you to quickly expose the generative capabilities of your agents through the MCP, enabling clients to "ask" your agents questions directly.

## Methods

These are the functions you can call on an `MCPServer` instance to control its behavior and get information.

### startStdio()

Use this method to start the server so it communicates using standard input and output (stdio). This is typical when running the server as a command-line program.

```typescript
async startStdio(): Promise<void>
```

Here's how you would start the server using stdio:

```typescript
const server = new MCPServer({
  // example configuration above
});
await server.startStdio();
```

### startSSE()

This method helps you integrate the MCP server with an existing web server to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication. You'll call this from your web server's code when it receives a request for the SSE or message paths.

```typescript
async startSSE({
  url,
  ssePath,
  messagePath,
  req,
  res,
}: {
  url: URL;
  ssePath: string;
  messagePath: string;
  req: any;
  res: any;
}): Promise<void>
```

Here's an example of how you might use `startSSE` within an HTTP server request handler. In this example an MCP client could connect to your MCP server at `http://localhost:1234/sse`:

```typescript
import http from "http";

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  await server.startSSE({
    url: new URL(req.url || "", `http://localhost:1234`),
    ssePath: "/sse",
    messagePath: "/message",
    req,
    res,
  });
});

httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Here are the details for the values needed by the `startSSE` method:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "url",
      type: "URL",
      description: "The web address the user is requesting.",
    },
    {
      name: "ssePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will connect for SSE (e.g., '/sse').",
    },
    {
      name: "messagePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will send messages (e.g., '/message').",
    },
    {
      name: "req",
      type: "any",
      description: "The incoming request object from your web server.",
    },
    {
      name: "res",
      type: "any",
      description:
        "The response object from your web server, used to send data back.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### startHonoSSE()

This method helps you integrate the MCP server with an existing web server to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication. You'll call this from your web server's code when it receives a request for the SSE or message paths.

```typescript
async startHonoSSE({
  url,
  ssePath,
  messagePath,
  req,
  res,
}: {
  url: URL;
  ssePath: string;
  messagePath: string;
  req: any;
  res: any;
}): Promise<void>
```

Here's an example of how you might use `startHonoSSE` within an HTTP server request handler. In this example an MCP client could connect to your MCP server at `http://localhost:1234/hono-sse`:

```typescript
import http from "http";

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  await server.startHonoSSE({
    url: new URL(req.url || "", `http://localhost:1234`),
    ssePath: "/hono-sse",
    messagePath: "/message",
    req,
    res,
  });
});

httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Here are the details for the values needed by the `startHonoSSE` method:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "url",
      type: "URL",
      description: "The web address the user is requesting.",
    },
    {
      name: "ssePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will connect for SSE (e.g., '/hono-sse').",
    },
    {
      name: "messagePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will send messages (e.g., '/message').",
    },
    {
      name: "req",
      type: "any",
      description: "The incoming request object from your web server.",
    },
    {
      name: "res",
      type: "any",
      description:
        "The response object from your web server, used to send data back.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### startHTTP()

This method helps you integrate the MCP server with an existing web server to use streamable HTTP for communication. You'll call this from your web server's code when it receives HTTP requests.

```typescript
async startHTTP({
  url,
  httpPath,
  req,
  res,
  options = { sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID() },
}: {
  url: URL;
  httpPath: string;
  req: http.IncomingMessage;
  res: http.ServerResponse<http.IncomingMessage>;
  options?: StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions;
}): Promise<void>
```

Here's an example of how you might use `startHTTP` within an HTTP server request handler. In this example an MCP client could connect to your MCP server at `http://localhost:1234/http`:

```typescript
import http from "http";

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  await server.startHTTP({
    url: new URL(req.url || '', 'http://localhost:1234'),
    httpPath: `/mcp`,
    req,
    res,
    options: {
      sessionIdGenerator: undefined,
    },
  });
});

httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Here are the details for the values needed by the `startHTTP` method:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: 'url',
      type: 'URL',
      description: 'The web address the user is requesting.',
    },
    {
      name: 'httpPath',
      type: 'string',
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where the MCP server will handle HTTP requests (e.g., '/mcp').",
    },
    {
      name: 'req',
      type: 'http.IncomingMessage',
      description: 'The incoming request object from your web server.',
    },
    {
      name: 'res',
      type: 'http.ServerResponse',
      description:
        'The response object from your web server, used to send data back.',
    },
    {
      name: 'options',
      type: 'StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions',
      description:
        'Optional configuration for the HTTP transport. See the options table below for more details.',
      optional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

The `StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions` object allows you to customize the behavior of the HTTP transport. Here are the available options:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: 'sessionIdGenerator',
      type: '(() => string) | undefined',
      description:
        'A function that generates a unique session ID. This should be a cryptographically secure, globally unique string. Return `undefined` to disable session management.',
    },
    {
      name: 'onsessioninitialized',
      type: '(sessionId: string) => void',
      description:
        'A callback that is invoked when a new session is initialized. This is useful for tracking active MCP sessions.',
      optional: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'enableJsonResponse',
      type: 'boolean',
      description:
        'If `true`, the server will return plain JSON responses instead of using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming. Defaults to `false`.',
      optional: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'eventStore',
      type: 'EventStore',
      description:
        'An event store for message resumability. Providing this enables clients to reconnect and resume message streams.',
      optional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

### close()

This method closes the server and releases all resources.

```typescript
async close(): Promise<void>
```

### getServerInfo()

This method gives you a look at the server's basic information.

```typescript
getServerInfo(): ServerInfo
```

### getServerDetail()

This method gives you a detailed look at the server's information.

```typescript
getServerDetail(): ServerDetail
```

### getToolListInfo()

This method gives you a look at the tools that were set up when you created the server. It's a read-only list, useful for debugging purposes.

```typescript
getToolListInfo(): ToolListInfo
```

### getToolInfo()

This method gives you detailed information about a specific tool.

```typescript
getToolInfo(toolName: string): ToolInfo
```

### executeTool()

This method executes a specific tool and returns the result.

```typescript
executeTool(toolName: string, input: any): Promise<any>
```

### getStdioTransport()

If you started the server with `startStdio()`, you can use this to get the object that manages the stdio communication. This is mostly for checking things internally or for testing.

```typescript
getStdioTransport(): StdioServerTransport | undefined
```

### getSseTransport()

If you started the server with `startSSE()`, you can use this to get the object that manages the SSE communication. Like `getStdioTransport`, this is mainly for internal checks or testing.

```typescript
getSseTransport(): SSEServerTransport | undefined
```

### getSseHonoTransport()

If you started the server with `startHonoSSE()`, you can use this to get the object that manages the SSE communication. Like `getSseTransport`, this is mainly for internal checks or testing.

```typescript
getSseHonoTransport(): SSETransport | undefined
```

### getStreamableHTTPTransport()

If you started the server with `startHTTP()`, you can use this to get the object that manages the HTTP communication. Like `getSseTransport`, this is mainly for internal checks or testing.

```typescript
getStreamableHTTPTransport(): StreamableHTTPServerTransport | undefined
```

### tools()

Executes a specific tool provided by this MCP server.

```typescript
async executeTool(
  toolId: string,
  args: any,
  executionContext?: { messages?: any[]; toolCallId?: string },
): Promise<any>
```

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "toolId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID/name of the tool to execute.",
    },
    {
      name: "args",
      type: "any",
      description: "The arguments to pass to the tool\'s execute function.",
    },
    {
      name: "executionContext",
      type: "object",
      isOptional: true,
      description:
        "Optional context for the tool execution, like messages or a toolCallId.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Resource Handling

### What are MCP Resources?

Resources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions. They represent any kind of data that an MCP server wants to make available, such as:

- File contents
- Database records
- API responses
- Live system data
- Screenshots and images
- Log files

Resources are identified by unique URIs (e.g., `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf`, `postgres://database/customers/schema`) and can contain either text (UTF-8 encoded) or binary data (base64 encoded).

Clients can discover resources through:

1.  **Direct resources**: Servers expose a list of concrete resources via a `resources/list` endpoint.
2.  **Resource templates**: For dynamic resources, servers can expose URI templates (RFC 6570) that clients use to construct resource URIs.

To read a resource, clients make a `resources/read` request with the URI. Servers can also notify clients about changes to the resource list (`notifications/resources/list_changed`) or updates to specific resource content (`notifications/resources/updated`) if a client has subscribed to that resource.

For more detailed information, refer to the [official MCP documentation on Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources).

### `MCPServerResources` Type

The `resources` option takes an object of type `MCPServerResources`. This type defines the callbacks your server will use to handle resource requests:

```typescript
export type MCPServerResources = {
  // Callback to list available resources
  listResources: () => Promise<Resource[]>;

  // Callback to get the content of a specific resource
  getResourceContent: ({
    uri,
  }: {
    uri: string;
  }) => Promise<MCPServerResourceContent | MCPServerResourceContent[]>;

  // Optional callback to list available resource templates
  resourceTemplates?: () => Promise<ResourceTemplate[]>;
};

export type MCPServerResourceContent = { text?: string } | { blob?: string };
```

Example:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import type {
  MCPServerResourceContent,
  Resource,
  ResourceTemplate,
} from "@mastra/mcp";

// Resources/resource templates will generally be dynamically fetched.
const myResources: Resource[] = [
  { uri: "file://data/123.txt", name: "Data File", mimeType: "text/plain" },
];

const myResourceContents: Record<string, MCPServerResourceContent> = {
  "file://data.txt/123": { text: "This is the content of the data file." },
};

const myResourceTemplates: ResourceTemplate[] = [
  {
    uriTemplate: "file://data/{id}",
    name: "Data File",
    description: "A file containing data.",
    mimeType: "text/plain",
  },
];

const myResourceHandlers: MCPServerResources = {
  listResources: async () => myResources,
  getResourceContent: async ({ uri }) => {
    if (myResourceContents[uri]) {
      return myResourceContents[uri];
    }
    throw new Error(`Resource content not found for ${uri}`);
  },
  resourceTemplates: async () => myResourceTemplates,
};

const serverWithResources = new MCPServer({
  name: "Resourceful Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: {
    /* ... your tools ... */
  },
  resources: myResourceHandlers,
});
```

### Notifying Clients of Resource Changes

If the available resources or their content change, your server can notify connected clients that are subscribed to the specific resource.

#### `server.resources.notifyUpdated({ uri: string })`

Call this method when the content of a specific resource (identified by its `uri`) has been updated. If any clients are subscribed to this URI, they will receive a `notifications/resources/updated` message.

```typescript
async server.resources.notifyUpdated({ uri: string }): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
// After updating the content of 'file://data.txt'
await serverWithResources.resources.notifyUpdated({ uri: "file://data.txt" });
```

#### `server.resources.notifyListChanged()`

Call this method when the overall list of available resources has changed (e.g., a resource was added or removed). This will send a `notifications/resources/list_changed` message to clients, prompting them to re-fetch the list of resources.

```typescript
async server.resources.notifyListChanged(): Promise<void>
```

Example:

```typescript
// After adding a new resource to the list managed by 'myResourceHandlers.listResources'
await serverWithResources.resources.notifyListChanged();
```

## Prompt Handling

### What are MCP Prompts?

Prompts are reusable templates or workflows that MCP servers expose to clients. They can accept arguments, include resource context, support versioning, and be used to standardize LLM interactions.

Prompts are identified by a unique name (and optional version) and can be dynamic or static.

### `MCPServerPrompts` Type

The `prompts` option takes an object of type `MCPServerPrompts`. This type defines the callbacks your server will use to handle prompt requests:

```typescript
export type MCPServerPrompts = {
  // Callback to list available prompts
  listPrompts: () => Promise<Prompt[]>;

  // Callback to get the messages/content for a specific prompt
  getPromptMessages?: ({
    name,
    version,
    args,
  }: {
    name: string;
    version?: string;
    args?: any;
  }) => Promise<{ prompt: Prompt; messages: PromptMessage[] }>;
};
```

Example:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import type { Prompt, PromptMessage, MCPServerPrompts } from "@mastra/mcp";

const prompts: Prompt[] = [
  {
    name: "analyze-code",
    description: "Analyze code for improvements",
    version: "v1"
  },
  {
    name: "analyze-code",
    description: "Analyze code for improvements (new logic)",
    version: "v2"
  }
];

const myPromptHandlers: MCPServerPrompts = {
  listPrompts: async () => prompts,
  getPromptMessages: async ({ name, version, args }) => {
    if (name === "analyze-code") {
      if (version === "v2") {
        const prompt = prompts.find(p => p.name === name && p.version === "v2");
        if (!prompt) throw new Error("Prompt version not found");
        return {
          prompt,
          messages: [
            {
              role: "user",
              content: { type: "text", text: `Analyze this code with the new logic: ${args.code}` }
            }
          ]
        };
      }
      // Default or v1
      const prompt = prompts.find(p => p.name === name && p.version === "v1");
      if (!prompt) throw new Error("Prompt version not found");
      return {
        prompt,
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: { type: "text", text: `Analyze this code: ${args.code}` }
          }
        ]
      };
    }
    throw new Error("Prompt not found");
  }
};

const serverWithPrompts = new MCPServer({
  name: "Promptful Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: { /* ... */ },
  prompts: myPromptHandlers,
});
```

### Notifying Clients of Prompt Changes

If the available prompts change, your server can notify connected clients:

#### `server.prompts.notifyListChanged()`

Call this method when the overall list of available prompts has changed (e.g., a prompt was added or removed). This will send a `notifications/prompts/list_changed` message to clients, prompting them to re-fetch the list of prompts.

```typescript
await serverWithPrompts.prompts.notifyListChanged();
```

### Best Practices for Prompt Handling

- Use clear, descriptive prompt names and descriptions.
- Validate all required arguments in `getPromptMessages`.
- Include a `version` field if you expect to make breaking changes.
- Use the `version` parameter to select the correct prompt logic.
- Notify clients when prompt lists change.
- Handle errors with informative messages.
- Document argument expectations and available versions.

## Examples

For practical examples of setting up and deploying an MCPServer, see the [Deploying an MCPServer Example](/examples/agents/deploying-mcp-server).

The example at the beginning of this page also demonstrates how to instantiate `MCPServer` with both tools and agents.

## Elicitation

### What is Elicitation?

Elicitation is a feature in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows servers to request structured information from users. This enables interactive workflows where servers can collect additional data dynamically.

The `MCPServer` class automatically includes elicitation capabilities. Tools receive an `options` parameter in their `execute` function that includes an `elicitation.sendRequest()` method for requesting user input.

### Tool Execution Signature

When tools are executed within an MCP server context, they receive an additional `options` parameter:

```typescript
execute: async ({ context }, options) => {
  // context contains the tool's input parameters
  // options contains server capabilities like elicitation
  
  const result = await options.elicitation.sendRequest({
    message: "Please provide information",
    requestedSchema: { /* schema */ }
  });
  
  return result;
}
```

### How Elicitation Works

A common use case is during tool execution. When a tool needs user input, it can use the elicitation functionality provided through the tool's execution options:

1. The tool calls `options.elicitation.sendRequest()` with a message and schema
2. The request is sent to the connected MCP client
3. The client presents the request to the user (via UI, command line, etc.)
4. The user provides input, rejects, or cancels the request
5. The client sends the response back to the server
6. The tool receives the response and continues execution

### Using Elicitation in Tools

Here's an example of a tool that uses elicitation to collect user contact information:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: "Interactive Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: {
    collectContactInfo: createTool({
      id: "collectContactInfo",
      description: "Collects user contact information through elicitation",
      inputSchema: z.object({
        reason: z.string().optional().describe("Reason for collecting contact info"),
      }),
      execute: async ({ context }, options) => {
        const { reason } = context;

        try {
          // Request user input via elicitation through the options parameter
          const result = await options.elicitation.sendRequest({
            message: reason 
              ? `Please provide your contact information. ${reason}`
              : 'Please provide your contact information',
            requestedSchema: {
              type: 'object',
              properties: {
                name: {
                  type: 'string',
                  title: 'Full Name',
                  description: 'Your full name',
                },
                email: {
                  type: 'string',
                  title: 'Email Address', 
                  description: 'Your email address',
                  format: 'email',
                },
                phone: {
                  type: 'string',
                  title: 'Phone Number',
                  description: 'Your phone number (optional)',
                },
              },
              required: ['name', 'email'],
            },
          });

          // Handle the user's response
          if (result.action === 'accept') {
            return `Contact information collected: ${JSON.stringify(result.content, null, 2)}`;
          } else if (result.action === 'reject') {
            return 'Contact information collection was declined by the user.';
          } else {
            return 'Contact information collection was cancelled by the user.';
          }
        } catch (error) {
          return `Error collecting contact information: ${error}`;
        }
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### Elicitation Request Schema

The `requestedSchema` must be a flat object with primitive properties only. Supported types include:

- **String**: `{ type: 'string', title: 'Display Name', description: 'Help text' }`
- **Number**: `{ type: 'number', minimum: 0, maximum: 100 }`
- **Boolean**: `{ type: 'boolean', default: false }`
- **Enum**: `{ type: 'string', enum: ['option1', 'option2'] }`

Example schema:

```typescript
{
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      title: 'Full Name',
      description: 'Your complete name',
    },
    age: {
      type: 'number',
      title: 'Age',
      minimum: 18,
      maximum: 120,
    },
    newsletter: {
      type: 'boolean',
      title: 'Subscribe to Newsletter',
      default: false,
    },
  },
  required: ['name'],
}
```

### Response Actions

Users can respond to elicitation requests in three ways:

1. **Accept** (`action: 'accept'`): User provided data and confirmed submission
   - Contains `content` field with the submitted data
2. **Reject** (`action: 'reject'`): User explicitly declined to provide information
   - No content field
3. **Cancel** (`action: 'cancel'`): User dismissed the request without deciding
   - No content field

Tools should handle all three response types appropriately.

### Security Considerations

- **Never request sensitive information** like passwords, SSNs, or credit card numbers
- Validate all user input against the provided schema
- Handle rejection and cancellation gracefully
- Provide clear reasons for data collection
- Respect user privacy and preferences

### Tool Execution API

The elicitation functionality is available through the `options` parameter in tool execution:

```typescript
// Within a tool's execute function
options.elicitation.sendRequest({
  message: string,           // Message to display to user
  requestedSchema: object    // JSON schema defining expected response structure
}): Promise<ElicitResult>
```

Note that elicitation is **session-aware** when using HTTP-based transports (SSE or HTTP). This means that when multiple clients are connected to the same server, elicitation requests are routed to the correct client session that initiated the tool execution.

The `ElicitResult` type:

```typescript
type ElicitResult = {
  action: 'accept' | 'reject' | 'cancel';
  content?: any; // Only present when action is 'accept'
}
```

# createVectorQueryTool()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/tools/vector-query-tool

The `createVectorQueryTool()` function creates a tool for semantic search over vector stores. It supports filtering, reranking, database-specific configurations, and integrates with various vector store backends.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { createVectorQueryTool } from "@mastra/rag";

const queryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});
```

## Parameters

<Callout>
  **Parameter Requirements:** Most fields can be set at creation as defaults.
  Some fields can be overridden at runtime via the runtime context or input. If
  a required field is missing from both creation and runtime, an error will be
  thrown. Note that `model`, `id`, and `description` can only be set at creation
  time.

            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

The tool returns an object with:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "relevantContext",
      type: "string",
      description: "Combined text from the most relevant document chunks",
    },
    {
      name: "sources",
      type: "QueryResult[]",
      description:
        "Array of full retrieval result objects. Each object contains all information needed to reference the original document, chunk, and similarity score.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### QueryResult object structure

```typescript
{
  id: string;         // Unique chunk/document identifier
  metadata: any;      // All metadata fields (document ID, etc.)
  vector: number[];   // Embedding vector (if available)
  score: number;      // Similarity score for this retrieval
  document: string;   // Full chunk/document text (if available)
}
```

## Default Tool Description

The default description focuses on:

- Finding relevant information in stored knowledge
- Answering user questions
- Retrieving factual content

## Result Handling

The tool determines the number of results to return based on the user's query, with a default of 10 results. This can be adjusted based on the query requirements.

## Example with Filters

```typescript
const queryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  enableFilter: true,
});
```

With filtering enabled, the tool processes queries to construct metadata filters that combine with semantic search. The process works as follows:

1. A user makes a query with specific filter requirements like "Find content where the 'version' field is greater than 2.0"
2. The agent analyzes the query and constructs the appropriate filters:
   ```typescript
   {
      "version": { "$gt": 2.0 }
   }
   ```

This agent-driven approach:

- Processes natural language queries into filter specifications
- Implements vector store-specific filter syntax
- Translates query terms to filter operators

For detailed filter syntax and store-specific capabilities, see the [Metadata Filters](../rag/metadata-filters) documentation.

For an example of how agent-driven filtering works, see the [Agent-Driven Metadata Filtering](../../../examples/rag/usage/filter-rag) example.

## Example with Reranking

```typescript
const queryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "milvus",
  indexName: "documentation",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  reranker: {
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    options: {
      weights: {
        semantic: 0.5, // Semantic relevance weight
        vector: 0.3, // Vector similarity weight
        position: 0.2, // Original position weight
      },
      topK: 5,
    },
  },
});
```

Reranking improves result quality by combining:

- Semantic relevance: Using LLM-based scoring of text similarity
- Vector similarity: Original vector distance scores
- Position bias: Consideration of original result ordering
- Query analysis: Adjustments based on query characteristics

The reranker processes the initial vector search results and returns a reordered list optimized for relevance.

## Example with Custom Description

```typescript
const queryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  description:
    "Search through document archives to find relevant information for answering questions about company policies and procedures",
});
```

This example shows how to customize the tool description for a specific use case while maintaining its core purpose of information retrieval.

## Database-Specific Configuration Examples

The `databaseConfig` parameter allows you to leverage unique features and optimizations specific to each vector database. These configurations are automatically applied during query execution.

    ### Pinecone Configuration

    ```typescript
    const pineconeQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
      indexName: "docs",
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
      databaseConfig: {
        pinecone: {
          namespace: "production",  // Organize vectors by environment
          sparseVector: {          // Enable hybrid search
            indices: [0, 1, 2, 3],
            values: [0.1, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05]
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    **Pinecone Features:**
    - **Namespace**: Isolate different data sets within the same index
    - **Sparse Vector**: Combine dense and sparse embeddings for improved search quality
    - **Use Cases**: Multi-tenant applications, hybrid semantic search
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### pgVector Configuration

    ```typescript
    const pgVectorQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "postgres",
      indexName: "embeddings",
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
      databaseConfig: {
        pgvector: {
          minScore: 0.7,    // Only return results above 70% similarity
          ef: 200,          // Higher value = better accuracy, slower search
          probes: 10        // For IVFFlat: more probes = better recall
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    **pgVector Features:**
    - **minScore**: Filter out low-quality matches
    - **ef (HNSW)**: Control accuracy vs speed for HNSW indexes
    - **probes (IVFFlat)**: Control recall vs speed for IVFFlat indexes
    - **Use Cases**: Performance tuning, quality filtering
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Chroma Configuration

    ```typescript
    const chromaQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "chroma",
      indexName: "documents",
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
      databaseConfig: {
        chroma: {
          where: {                    // Metadata filtering
            "category": "technical",
            "status": "published"
          },
          whereDocument: {            // Document content filtering
            "$contains": "API"
          }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    **Chroma Features:**
    - **where**: Filter by metadata fields
    - **whereDocument**: Filter by document content
    - **Use Cases**: Advanced filtering, content-based search
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    ### Multiple Database Configurations

    ```typescript
    // Configure for multiple databases (useful for dynamic stores)
    const multiDbQueryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
      vectorStoreName: "dynamic-store", // Will be set at runtime
      indexName: "docs",
      model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
      databaseConfig: {
        pinecone: {
          namespace: "default"
        },
        pgvector: {
          minScore: 0.8,
          ef: 150
        },
        chroma: {
          where: { "type": "documentation" }
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    **Multi-Config Benefits:**
    - Support multiple vector stores with one tool
    - Database-specific optimizations are automatically applied
    - Flexible deployment scenarios
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Runtime Configuration Override

You can override database configurations at runtime to adapt to different scenarios:

```typescript
import { RuntimeContext } from '@mastra/core/runtime-context';

const queryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
  databaseConfig: {
    pinecone: {
      namespace: "development"
    }
  }
});

// Override at runtime
const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
runtimeContext.set('databaseConfig', {
  pinecone: {
    namespace: 'production'  // Switch to production namespace
  }
});

const response = await agent.generate(
  "Find information about deployment",
  { runtimeContext }
);
```

This approach allows you to:
- Switch between environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Adjust performance parameters based on load
- Apply different filtering strategies per request

## Example: Using Runtime Context

```typescript
const queryTool = createVectorQueryTool({
  vectorStoreName: "pinecone",
  indexName: "docs",
  model: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
});
```

When using runtime context, provide required parameters at execution time via the runtime context:

```typescript
const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext<{
  vectorStoreName: string;
  indexName: string;
  topK: number;
  filter: VectorFilter;
  databaseConfig: DatabaseConfig;
}>();
runtimeContext.set("vectorStoreName", "my-store");
runtimeContext.set("indexName", "my-index");
runtimeContext.set("topK", 5);
runtimeContext.set("filter", { category: "docs" });
runtimeContext.set("databaseConfig", {
  pinecone: { namespace: "runtime-namespace" }
});
runtimeContext.set("model", openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"));

const response = await agent.generate(
  "Find documentation from the knowledge base.",
  {
    runtimeContext,
  },
);
```

For more information on runtime context, please see:

- [Runtime Variables](../../docs/agents/runtime-variables)
- [Dynamic Context](../../docs/tools-mcp/dynamic-context)

## Tool Details

The tool is created with:

- **ID**: `VectorQuery {vectorStoreName} {indexName} Tool`
- **Input Schema**: Requires queryText and filter objects

# Snapshots
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/workflows/snapshots

In Mastra, a snapshot is a serializable representation of a workflow's complete execution state at a specific point in time. Snapshots capture all the information needed to resume a workflow from exactly where it left off, including:

- The current state of each step in the workflow
- The outputs of completed steps
- The execution path taken through the workflow
- Any suspended steps and their metadata
- The remaining retry attempts for each step
- Additional contextual data needed to resume execution

Snapshots are automatically created and managed by Mastra whenever a workflow is suspended, and are persisted to the configured storage system.

## The Role of Snapshots in Suspend and Resume

Snapshots are the key mechanism enabling Mastra's suspend and resume capabilities. When a workflow step calls `await suspend()`:

1. The workflow execution is paused at that exact point
2. The current state of the workflow is captured as a snapshot
3. The snapshot is persisted to storage
4. The workflow step is marked as "suspended" with a status of `'suspended'`
5. Later, when `resume()` is called on the suspended step, the snapshot is retrieved
6. The workflow execution resumes from exactly where it left off

This mechanism provides a powerful way to implement human-in-the-loop workflows, handle rate limiting, wait for external resources, and implement complex branching workflows that may need to pause for extended periods.

## Snapshot Anatomy

A Mastra workflow snapshot consists of several key components:

```typescript
export interface WorkflowRunState {
  // Core state info
  value: Record<string, string>; // Current state machine value
  context: {
    // Workflow context
    [key: string]: Record<
      string,
      | {
          status: "success";
          output: any;
        }
      | {
          status: "failed";
          error: string;
        }
      | {
          status: "suspended";
          payload?: any;
        }
    >;
    input: Record<string, any>; // Initial input data
  };

  activePaths: Array<{
    // Currently active execution paths
    stepPath: string[];
    stepId: string;
    status: string;
  }>;

  // Paths to suspended steps
  suspendedPaths: Record<string, number[]>;

  // Metadata
  runId: string; // Unique run identifier
  timestamp: number; // Time snapshot was created
}
```

## How Snapshots Are Saved and Retrieved

Mastra persists snapshots to the configured storage system. By default, snapshots are saved to a LibSQL database, but can be configured to use other storage providers like Upstash.
The snapshots are stored in the `workflow_snapshots` table and identified uniquely by the `run_id` for the associated run when using libsql.
Utilizing a persistence layer allows for the snapshots to be persisted across workflow runs, allowing for advanced human-in-the-loop functionality.

Read more about [libsql storage](../storage/libsql.mdx) and [upstash storage](../storage/upstash.mdx) here.

### Saving Snapshots

When a workflow is suspended, Mastra automatically persists the workflow snapshot with these steps:

1. The `suspend()` function in a step execution triggers the snapshot process
2. The `WorkflowInstance.suspend()` method records the suspended machine
3. `persistWorkflowSnapshot()` is called to save the current state
4. The snapshot is serialized and stored in the configured database in the `workflow_snapshots` table
5. The storage record includes the workflow name, run ID, and the serialized snapshot

### Retrieving Snapshots

When a workflow is resumed, Mastra retrieves the persisted snapshot with these steps:

1. The `resume()` method is called with a specific step ID
2. The snapshot is loaded from storage using `loadWorkflowSnapshot()`
3. The snapshot is parsed and prepared for resumption
4. The workflow execution is recreated with the snapshot state
5. The suspended step is resumed, and execution continues

## Storage Options for Snapshots

Mastra provides multiple storage options for persisting snapshots.

A `storage` instance is configured on the `Mastra` class, and is used to setup a snapshot persistence layer for all workflows registered on the `Mastra` instance.
This means that storage is shared across all workflows registered with the same `Mastra` instance.

### LibSQL (Default)

The default storage option is LibSQL, a SQLite-compatible database:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { DefaultStorage } from "@mastra/core/storage/libsql";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new DefaultStorage({
    config: {
      url: "file:storage.db", // Local file-based database
      // For production:
      // url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
      // authToken: process.env.DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN,
    },
  }),
  workflows: {
    weatherWorkflow,
    travelWorkflow,
  },
});
```

### Upstash (Redis-Compatible)

For serverless environments:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { UpstashStore } from "@mastra/upstash";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  storage: new UpstashStore({
    url: process.env.UPSTASH_URL,
    token: process.env.UPSTASH_TOKEN,
  }),
  workflows: {
    weatherWorkflow,
    travelWorkflow,
  },
});
```

## Best Practices for Working with Snapshots

1. **Ensure Serializability**: Any data that needs to be included in the snapshot must be serializable (convertible to JSON).

2. **Minimize Snapshot Size**: Avoid storing large data objects directly in the workflow context. Instead, store references to them (like IDs) and retrieve the data when needed.

3. **Handle Resume Context Carefully**: When resuming a workflow, carefully consider what context to provide. This will be merged with the existing snapshot data.

4. **Set Up Proper Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for suspended workflows, especially long-running ones, to ensure they are properly resumed.

5. **Consider Storage Scaling**: For applications with many suspended workflows, ensure your storage solution is appropriately scaled.

## Advanced Snapshot Patterns

### Custom Snapshot Metadata

When suspending a workflow, you can include custom metadata that can help when resuming:

```typescript
await suspend({
  reason: "Waiting for customer approval",
  requiredApprovers: ["manager", "finance"],
  requestedBy: currentUser,
  urgency: "high",
  expires: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
});
```

This metadata is stored with the snapshot and available when resuming.

### Conditional Resumption

You can implement conditional logic based on the suspend payload when resuming:

```typescript
run.watch(async ({ activePaths }) => {
  const isApprovalStepSuspended =
    activePaths.get("approval")?.status === "suspended";
  if (isApprovalStepSuspended) {
    const payload = activePaths.get("approval")?.suspendPayload;
    if (payload.urgency === "high" && currentUser.role === "manager") {
      await resume({
        stepId: "approval",
        context: { approved: true, approver: currentUser.id },
      });
    }
  }
});
```

# Step
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/workflows/step

The Step class defines individual units of work within a workflow, encapsulating execution logic, data validation, and input/output handling.
It can take either a tool or an agent as a parameter to automatically create a step from them.

## Usage

```typescript
import { createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const processOrder = createStep({
  id: "processOrder",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    orderId: z.string(),
    userId: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    status: z.string(),
    orderId: z.string(),
  }),
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    orderId: z.string(),
  }),
  suspendSchema: z.object({}),
  execute: async ({
    inputData,
    mastra,
    getStepResult,
    getInitData,
    suspend,
    runtimeContext,
    runCount
    runId,
  }) => {
    return {
      status: "processed",
      orderId: inputData.orderId,
    };
  },
});

# Workflow.watch()
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/workflows/watch

The `.watch()` method allows you to monitor the execution of a workflow run, providing real-time updates on the status of steps.

## Usage

```typescript
const run = await myWorkflow.createRunAsync();

// Add a watcher to monitor execution
run.watch(event => {
  console.log('Step completed:', event.payload.currentStep.id);
});

// Start the workflow
const result = await run.start({ inputData: {...} });
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "cb",
      type: "(event: WatchEvent) => void",
      description:
        "A callback function that is called whenever a step is completed or the workflow state changes",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "unwatch",
      type: "() => void",
      description:
        "A function that can be called to stop watching the workflow run",
    },
  ]}
/>

# Workflow Class
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/reference/workflows/workflow

The Workflow class enables you to create state machines for complex sequences of operations with conditional branching and data validation.

## Usage

```typescript
const myWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "my-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    startValue: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    result: z.string(),
  }),
  steps: [step1, step2, step3], // Declare steps used in this workflow
})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .then(step3)
  .commit();

const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: {
    myWorkflow,
  },
});

const run = await mastra.getWorkflow("myWorkflow").createRunAsync();
```

## API Reference

### Constructor

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for the workflow",
    },
    {
      name: "inputSchema",
      type: "z.ZodType<any>",
      description: "Zod schema defining the input structure for the workflow",
    },
    {
      name: "outputSchema",
      type: "z.ZodType<any>",
      description: "Zod schema defining the output structure for the workflow",
    },
    {
      name: "steps",
      type: "Step[]",
      description: "Array of steps to include in the workflow",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Core Methods

#### `then()`

Adds a step to the workflow sequentially. Returns the workflow instance for chaining.

#### `parallel()`

Executes multiple steps concurrently. Takes an array of steps and returns the workflow instance.

#### `branch()`

Creates conditional branching logic. Takes an array of tuples containing condition functions and steps to execute when conditions are met.

#### `dowhile()`

Creates a loop that executes a step repeatedly while a condition remains true. The condition is checked after each execution.

#### `dountil()`

Creates a loop that executes a step repeatedly until a condition becomes true. The condition is checked after each execution.

#### `foreach()`

Iterates over an array and executes a step for each element. Accepts optional concurrency configuration.

#### `map()`

Maps data between steps using either a mapping configuration object or a mapping function. Useful for transforming data between steps.

#### `commit()`

Validates and finalizes the workflow configuration. Must be called after adding all steps.

#### `createRun()`

Deprecated. Creates a new workflow run instance, allowing you to execute the workflow with specific input data. Accepts optional run ID.

#### `createRunAsync()`

Creates a new workflow run instance, allowing you to execute the workflow with specific input data. Accepts optional run ID. Stores a pending workflow run snapshot into storage.

#### `execute()`

Executes the workflow with provided input data. Handles workflow suspension, resumption and emits events during execution.

## Workflow Status

A workflow's status indicates its current execution state. The possible values are:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "success",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "All steps finished executing successfully, with a valid result output",
    },
    {
      name: "failed",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "Workflow encountered an error during execution, with error details available",
    },
    {
      name: "suspended",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "Workflow execution is paused waiting for resume, with suspended step information",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Passing Context Between Steps

Steps can access data from previous steps in the workflow through the context object. Each step receives the accumulated context from all previous steps that have executed.

```typescript
workflow
  .then({
    id: "getData",
    execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
      return {
        data: { id: "123", value: "example" },
      };
    },
  })
  .then({
    id: "processData",
    execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
      // Access data from previous step through context.steps
      const previousData = inputData.data;
      // Process previousData.id and previousData.value
    },
  });
```

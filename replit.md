# Overview

This is a Telegram bot application built on the Mastra framework for AI agent orchestration. The bot specializes in AI image generation using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model (nicknamed "Nano Banana" internally at Google) via hubai.loe.gg API. It features a complete user management system with daily usage limits, database storage for tracking image generations, and direct Google Generative AI SDK integration for enhanced functionality.

- **Tool System**: Extensible tools for image generation, user stats, subscription checks, and multimodal processing with support for multiple photo inputs
- **Memory Management**: Persistent conversation context with thread support for maintaining chat history

## Data Storage Solutions
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Primary data store using Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Design**: 
  - Users table for Telegram user management and daily limits tracking
  - Image generations table for history and audit trails
  - Foreign key relationships for data integrity
- **Daily Reset Logic**: Automatic counter resets based on date comparison for usage limits

## Authentication and Authorization
- **Telegram Integration**: Bot token-based authentication with webhook verification
- **Subscription System**: Channel membership verification (@ferixdi_ai) for access control
- **Rate Limiting**: Dual limit system - 3 images/day for private chats, 30 images/day for group chats (admin unlimited)
